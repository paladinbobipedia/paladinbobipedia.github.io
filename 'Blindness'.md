# Blindness

*A veil o' shadowed gloom, alack, doth shroud the orbs so bright,*
*Where once the sun's warm kiss did dance, now endless night takes flight.
*Yet valor dwells not in the sight, but in the heart's true gleam,
*And faith, a beacon in the dark, a guiding, sacred stream.*

## Causes of This Murk

Blindness, a grievous affliction, cometh in manifold guises, oft born of  the Malevolent's machinations or the cruel caprice of Fortune.  Plagues of pestilence may sear the very sight, whilst venomous bites and arcane maleficence can steal the light from weary eyes.  Ancient wounds, treachery's steel, or the relentless march of years themselves,  contribute to this lamentable state.  

## Manifestations of the Sightless Doom

The absence of vision presents in divers forms.  Complete ocular deprivation, a soul enshrouded in perpetual dark, is the gravest decree.  Yet, ofttimes, a blurring, dimming, or distortion plagues the gaze, hindering perception like a creeping fog.  Some suffer  seeing phantoms,  hallucinations weaving  fantastical tapestries  upon the mind's darkened canvas.

##  Navigating the World Unveiled

Though bereft of ocular guidance, the sightless soul doth not forfeit its place in this realm. Enhanced senses, like hearing and touch, sharpen with poignant acuity.  The faithful employ canes, trained hounds, and  the aid of compassionate companions to chart their course. Echolocation, a whispered art,  utilizes sound  to paint a sonic map of surroundings.  Moreover,  the indomitable spirit, fortified by faith and learning,  learns  new methods of "seeing"  through  tactile knowledge and  the echoes of memory.

##  A Paladin's Duty Amidst the Shadow

For a paladin, blindness presents not an impediment, but a crucible wherein courage is tempered. We, bound by oath to protect the vulnerable,  extend our aid with doubled fervor to those shrouded in darkness. Our other senses become extensions of our righteous purpose,  guiding our steps  to shield the sightless from harm.  Faith, our unwavering lantern,  illumines the path,  and compassion, our blade,  fights  against the encroaching shadows  of despair that  might seek to  grip the  heart  denied  the sun's embrace.
