# Wren

*A feathered sprite, of valor bright, doth Wren alight, a beacon in the night. With tiny breast and song so clear, she banishes all shadows, doth endear.*

## Physical Description

Wren, a creature of diminutive stature yet indomitable spirit, presents an aspect both quaint and valiant.  Her plumage, a tapestry woven of browns and greys, camouflages her amongst boughs, mirroring the stealth of a noble knight in shadowed forest. Yet, splashes of vibrant ochre upon her breast, akin to a paladin's gilded armor, bespeak a heart aflame with courage. Her keen eyes, twin obsidian jewels, pierce the veil of deceit, ever vigilant, ever watchful.  Wings, small as a nobleman's hand, beat with a puissance disproportionate to their size, enabling feats of aerial agility unmatched save by the swiftest falcon.

## Habitat and Habits

This avian champion favors woodlands deep, where ancient oaks stand sentinel and sun-dappled glades whisper secrets on the breeze. A dweller of tangled thickets and moss-draped hollows, she constructs her nest with meticulous care, a woven sanctuary mirroring the fortress a paladin builds against encroaching darkness.  Wren's dawn chorus, a cascade of melodious notes, doth rouse the forest, a clarion call to greet the nascent day, a hymn to the enduring light. Though solitary by nature, she displays a fierce protectiveness over her fledglings, a maternal valor echoing the paladin's oath to defend the innocent.

## Symbolism and Folklore

In hushed tales spun 'round crackling hearth fires, Wren embodies resilience and hidden strength. Like a paladin upholding justice unseen, she combats unseen threats to the woodland realm - serpents, vermin, and encroaching blight. Her tireless song is oft linked to hope's persistence, a reminder that even in deepest shade, a spark of brilliance endures.  Some whisper she carries the whispers of departed heroes on her wings, a feathered conduit between realms, linking the mortal and the ethereal, much as a paladin bridges the gap between humanity and divine purpose.
