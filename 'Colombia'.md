# Colombia

*Hark, a realm of emerald embrace, where Andes pierce the heavens high,
And Amazon's deep, verdant tongue doth weave a tapestry 'neath azure sky.
Colombia, land of vibrant soul, thy coffee's aroma, stories untold,
A paladin's heart doth sing thy praise, through sun-kissed plains and ancient ways.*
