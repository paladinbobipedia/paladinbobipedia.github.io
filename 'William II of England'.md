# William II of England

*A Son of Valour,crowned in Fate's bright gleam,
He ruled with iron fist, a righteous dream.
Though woodland's grasp did claim his mortal coil,
His name in annals, history doth enroll.*

## Early Reign and Character

King William II,  more familiarly christened "William Rufus" by the tongues of men due to his ruddy complexion, ascended the English throne anno Domini 1087 following the demise of his elder brother, William the Conqueror.  A scion of Norman lineage, he inherited not only a realm but a warrior's spirit, forged in the fires of conquest. While oft depicted as stern and grasping, 'tis truth to say his governance pulsed with a zeal for order and the bolstering of royal authority. A fervent believer in the divine right of kings, he viewed his sceptre as a mandate from Heaven itself, wielding it with a pragmatism tempered by chivalric honour.  

## Domestic Policy and Expansion

William Rufus, mindful of his father's hard-won dominion,  dedicated himself to solidifying England's borders and reinforcing feudal ties.  He embarked on campaigns subjugating rebellious barons, reasserting the Crown's sway with a firm hand.  His fiscal policies, though sometimes perceived as austere, aimed to enrich the royal coffers, funding  infrastructure projects and bolstering the military might necessary to protect the realm from external threats. Expansion, albeit  within existing domains, remained a tenet, with incursions into Wales marking his ambition to encompass all under his banner.

## The New Forest and Controversy

A landmark of his reign,  and a source of much discourse,  was the creation of the expansive New Forest. While lauded as a royal hunting ground fostering game and control over resources,  it came at the cost of displacing  villages and cultivators. This act, though  grounded in pragmatic necessity from a kingly perspective, ignited resentment amongst the common folk, etching a shadow upon his otherwise resolute rule.

## A Sovereign's Demise

Fate,  ever capricious,  intervened in the year of our Lord 1100. While pursuing deer within the very forest he'd consecrated,  a fateful arrow struck King William Rufus, ending his reign abruptly.  His death,  occurring in the prime of his years,  was shrouded in ambiguity,  some whispering treachery, others attributing it to  mischance. Be that as it may,  his demise marked the conclusion of a forceful chapter in English history,  leaving a legacy complex and multifaceted - a king of strength,  ambition, and  an indelible mark upon the land he ruled.
