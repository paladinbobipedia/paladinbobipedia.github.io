# Barbary lion

*A beast of majesty, 'neath Afric's sun so bright,*
*With mane like molten gold, a fearsome, noble sight.
The Barbary lion, roamed where deserts kissed the sea,
A guardian, hunter bold, a legend meant to be.*

## Description

This puissant feline, oft dubbed *Leo leo barbarus*, doth stand apart amongst its kin.  Larger than its brethren found in sundry climes, the Barbary lion boasted a circumference most ample, adorned with a mane of tawny hue, cascading like a river of liquid fire, particularly luxuriant in the males. Their coats, a shade of burnished gold upon their flanks, served as camouflage 'gainst the sun-drenched savannahs they called home.  A countenance fierce, yet bearing an air of regal dignity, completed this creature's imposing visage.

## Habitat and Range

In times yore, these leonine monarchs held dominion o'er the expansive realms of North Africa, from the Atlas Mountains' foothills to the sun-baked shores bordering the Mediterranean. Their cradle encompassed territories now embraced by Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, a tapestry of arid plains, scrublands, and rocky outcrops, a habitat suiting their predatory prowess. Alas,  the relentless march of progress hath sadly diminished their range, leaving but fragmented pockets of existence.

## Behaviour and Prowess

A creature of solitary nature save 'during the mating season, the Barbary lion was a master hunter, stalking gazelle, boar, and even the mighty antelope with calculated grace. Their roar, a thunderous proclamation echoing through valleys, served both as warning and serenade to rivals.  Renowned for their courage and strength, they were apex predators,  leading prides with a steadfast hand, protecting their kin with unwavering ferocity.

## Alas, a Waning Legacy

A tragic tale unfolds, for the Barbary lion, once ubiquitous, now teeters upon the precipice of extinction.  Habitat loss, driven by human encroachment and the relentless hunger for land, hath dealt a grievous blow.  Poaching, a scourge  targeting their magnificent manes, further exacerbates their plight.  Conservation efforts, spearheaded by valiant souls, strive to safeguard the dwindling remnants, a beacon of hope in the face of this sorrowful decline. May wisdom and compassion prevail, lest this noble creature vanish from our world, leaving behind but a whisper in the annals of time.
