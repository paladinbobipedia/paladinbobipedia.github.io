# Poison

*A pestilence veiled, a serpent's sly kiss,
Poison, thou art bane, a shadowed abyss.
In venom distilled, or herb's wicked brew,
Thou stealest life's light, a most grievous cue.*

## Definition and Nature

Poison, forsooth, is a fell concoction, a deleterious substance wrought to induce malady and, ofttimes, demise. It doth assail the very essence of mortal being, corrupting flesh and spirit alike.  Whether borne from the fangs of beast, the clandestine craft of apothecary, or the corrupted bloom of nightshade, its touch brings torment and a chilling reaper's dance. 

## Modes of Delivery

This insidious agent creeps through sundry avenues: inhalation of noxious fumes, ingestion via tainted sustenance or libations, or direct permeation through breaches in the skin. A cunning adversary may wield poisoned blades, arrows feathered with death, or even whisper treachery laced upon the wind, a miasma to befoul the lungs. Vigilance, therefore, is paramount against its manifold assaults.

## Types and Effects

The kingdom of Poison boasts a venomous diversity. Some, like wolfsbane, induce agonizing convulsions, whilst others,  mimicking slumber's embrace, steal breath with a silent hand (the dreaded lethality).  Neurotoxins paralyze, corrupting the very signals that govern movement. Putrefactive poisons fester, dissolving tissue from within. Each variant, a unique torment, demanding specific antidotal remedies.

## Countermeasures and Cures

Though a fearsome foe, Poison yields not entirely to despair. Learned healers, wielding ancient lore and potent elixirs, stand as bulwarks against its wrath. Antidotes, crafted with meticulous care,  can counteract specific poisons, purging the venom and restoring balance.  Furthermore, a Paladin's steadfast faith and sacred arts ofttimes offer protection, shielding the pure of heart from its insidious grasp. Vigilance, swift action, and knowledge of herbal countermeasures are the shield and sword against this invisible enemy.
