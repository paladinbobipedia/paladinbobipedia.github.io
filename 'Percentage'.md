# Percentage

*A hymn unto Proportion's Daughter, Percentage, she whose subtle tongue doth weave through realms of quantify, granting clarity to fractions vast and small. From merchant's bargain to battlefield's calculus, her light shineth, a beacon 'gainst the fog of the indeterminate.*

## Definition in the King's Lexicon

Percentage, a term most venerated in the discourse of ratios, denoteth a part expressed as a fraction of an hundred. Thus, fifty percent, heralded as "50%", signifieth precisely one half, or fifty out of every hundred units considered.  This elegant method allows for swift comparison and understanding of proportions, be they of goods, casualties, or the very fortune of a kingdom.

##  Calculation, the Paladin's Method

To ascertain percentage, follow these steps, as steadfast as a paladin's oath:

1. **Divisio:** Divide the lesser quantity (the part) by the greater quantity (the whole).
2. **Multiplicatio:** Multiply the resultant of this division by one hundred, thus affixing the decimal unto the noble banner of percentage.

   *Example:* Should a knight slay 30 foes out of a host of 100, his success rate is calculated thus: (30/100) * 100 = 30%, a valiant achievement indeed!

##  Application in the Realm

Percentage's utility doth extend far and wide:

* **Commerce:**  A merchant's markup, a buyer's discount, all find clarity through percentage.
* **Strategy:**  A general evaluating troop losses ("20% casualty rate") or siege success ("75% breach achieved").
* **Divinity:**  Even in matters of faith,  the tithe, a prescribed portion (often a percentage) given to the Church, finds its anchor in this noble system.


Percentage, a tool as vital as a sword and shield, empowers understanding in a world oft shrouded in complexity. May its wisdom ever guide our actions!
