# Rugby Union

*Hark! A hymn to valor upon verdant fields, where knaves and gentles alike doth clash in spirited fray, a ballet of bone and brawn 'neath azure skies. Rugby Union, a game of chivalry and grit, a test of mettle forged in unity and cunning strategy. Thus doth its legend unfold.*

## Origin and Lore

Rugby Union, a sport venerated in the fair isles of Albion, traceth its genesis to a hallowed academy – Rugby School. Legend speaketh of a young scholar, William Webb Ellis, in yon year of 1823, who, forsaking tradition's rigid path, audaciously carried the spheroid beyond the bound markers, birthing this novel contest. From humble beginnings, 'tis blossomed into a global spectacle, a crucible where nations contend with unwavering spirit.

## The Field of Combat

Upon a rectangular expanse of emerald, marked with posts like ancient sentinels, doth this epic unfold. Two squadrons of fifteen warriors each, arrayed in hues distinct, strive for dominion. The oblong ball, a hallowed talisman, must be advanced not by mundane hand-passing, but by artful carries, cunning kicks, and delicate offloads, ever seeking the hallowed try zone – a haven marked by those upright posts.

##  The Rites of Engagement

Each engagement commences with a scrum, a phalanx of interlocking limbs, a testament to raw strength and synchronized effort, wresting possession of the fallen spheroid. From thence, play flows – a mazy dance of surges, tackles, and strategic maneuvers.  Points are garnered through tries (touching the ball down in the opponent's zone), conversions (kicks after a try), penalties (awarded for infringements), and drop goals (placements kicked directly through the posts). 

##  The Paladin's Virtues in Play

Rugby Union, whilst a contest of physical prowess, echoes the Paladin's creed. **Courage** is manifest in fearless tackles and unwavering pursuit. **Reverence** lies in the respect shown for opponents and the unwritten codes of fair play. **Helpfulness** thrives in teammates uniting as a single, cohesive force,  lifting fallen comrades and strategizing collectively.  A true Paladin on the field embodies these virtues, wielding not sword nor shield, but agility, strategy, and unyielding team spirit.
