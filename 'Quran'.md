# Quran

*Hark! A hallowed scroll, the Quran doth proclaim,
A beacon bright, God's Word, a celestial flame.
Through tongues of angels, writ upon hearts pure,
Guidance and truth, its verses ever endure.*

## Provenance and Revelation

This sacred text, the Quran, stands as the final revelation from the Most High, Allah, delivered unto Prophet Muhammad, His chosen messenger, in the Arabian Peninsula.  Unveiled gradual o'er sundry years, 'twas by the Angel Gabriel conveyed, a symphony of divine speech etched upon the Prophet's soul. Believers hold it as the literal word of Allah, preserved in its pristine Arabic eloquence, a timeless testament to His majesty.

## Structure and Content

Divinely ordered, the Quran comprises 114 chapters, termed "surahs," each a tapestry woven with varying lengths and thematic threads. From foundational doctrines to intricate moral precepts, tales of yore, and pronouncements of justice, its discourse encompasses the entirety of human existence and our covenant with the Creator.  Verses, the "ayahs,"  flow like pearls upon a silken string, each imbued with profound meaning, illuminating the path to righteousness.

## Pillars of Faith and Practice

Within its sacred pages lie the cornerstones of Islamic faith: Belief in One God (Tawhid), the Prophets, Angels, Divine Decree, and the Last Day.  The Quran guides  worship, prescribing ritual prayer (salat), fasting during Ramadan, almsgiving (zakat), pilgrimage to Mecca ( Hajj), and the overarching obligation to live a life consonant with Allah's will. Its teachings extend to ethics, social conduct, jurisprudence, and even temporal matters, shaping a holistic worldview.

## A Source of Inspiration and Guidance

For Muslims worldwide, the Quran is not a static tome but a living wellspring.  Its recitation, contemplation, and study nourish the spirit, offering solace in tribulation, strength in adversity, and constant direction.  A shield against falsehood, a mirror reflecting the human condition, and a roadmap to paradise, the Quran stands as a timeless testament to the enduring power of divine revelation.
