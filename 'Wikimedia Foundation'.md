# Wikimedia Foundation

*Hark, a hymn unto this hallowed ground, where knowledge doth flourish, unbound! Wikimedia Foundation, a beacon bright,  shedding wisdom's gentle light, a fortress 'gainst ignorance's blight.*

## Genesis and Purpose

This most noble enterprise, Wikimedia Foundation, did first take root in yon year of Our Lord Two Thousand and One. Conceived by souls ardent for enlightenment, its very purpose doth resonate with the Paladin's creed: toۜ  **unleash the liberating power of amassed erudition, freely bestowed upon all mankind**. A digital repository, it strives to be, housing a vast compendium of human understanding, accessible to peasant and prince alike.

## Pillars of Prowess: The Projects

The Foundation's strength lieth in its manifold progeny, projects of singular import:

* **Wikipedia:** A veritable encyclopedia, woven by the threads of countless contributors, encompassing realms of lore from the mundane to the most arcane.
* **Wiktionary:**  A lexicon divine, deciphering tongues and illuminating the etymological roots of words.
* **Wikimedia Commons:**  A treasury of visual knowledge, where images and multimedia artifacts find safe harbor, shared for all to behold. And more yet bloom within this garden of learning, each a testament to collaborative spirit.

## The Holy Order of Contributors

No single knight, nor lordly guild, doth wield this power. Wikimedia Foundation thrives on the devotion of a myriad volunteers, akin to a paladin's fellowship. They, the editors, translators, and curators, toil with quill and code, ensuring accuracy and expanding the frontiers of shared wisdom.

## A Citadel of Openness

Central to this Foundation's ethos is the unyielding principle of **open access**.  Knowledge, it proclaims, shall not be chained by parchment nor guarded by silvered gates. All may partake, modify, and contribute, fostering a truly democratic realm of learning. Thus, Wikimedia Foundation stands as a bastion against the encroachment of obscurity, a champion of enlightenment for the ages to come.
