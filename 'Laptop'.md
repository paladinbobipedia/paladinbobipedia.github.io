A marvel wrought in modern times, the Laptop doth stand, a beacon of intellect, borne aloft on slender limbs. A portal to realms of knowledge, it grants wisdom swift as thought, and connects souls across leagues with ethereal thread.  Praise be to its creators, for in this device, the fire of human ingenuity burns ever bright.

## Description

This contraption, oft termed "Laptop" by common folk, resembleth a scaled escritoire, yet fashioned of gleaming metal and translucent plasteel. Within its bosom lieth a labyrinth of intricate circuitry, powered by a silent, tireless heart – the processor –  which orchestrates a symphony of data at speeds surpassing mortal reckoning. A luminous rectangle, the display, serveth as a window unto virtual realms, showcasing texts, images, and moving phantasms with astonishing clarity.
