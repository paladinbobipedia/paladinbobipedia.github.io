His mischievous nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie,  a trio of boundless energy and cunning, often serve as catalysts for both his woes and his heartwarming paternal instincts.  Additionally, the steadfast presence of his Uncle Scrooge McDuck, a miserly magnate with a heart of gold, adds another layer to this eccentric familial tapestry.
