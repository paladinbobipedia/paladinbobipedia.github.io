# Monarchy

*Hark, a system divine, where Heaven's grace doth intertwine with earthly sway, a lineage of valor, a bulwark 'gainst decay.  Monarchy, a tapestry woven with threads of justice and piety, a beacon guiding mortal souls through tempestuous sea.*

## Definition & Principles

Monarchy, in its purest form, stands as a realm governed by a Sovereign, a King or Queen, vested with supreme and hereditary authority. This dominion, bestowed by the very hand of Providence,  rests upon tenets of divine right, wherein the ruler's power is seen as a sacred mandate, a conduit for celestial order. Loyalty unto the Crown, thence unto God, forms the bedrock of this structure, ensuring stability and fostering unity 'neath one banner.

## Roles & Responsibilities

The Monarch, crowned with virtue and wisdom, doth bear burdens weighty as the heavens.  Firstly, they are the embodiment of the realm, a symbol of national identity and enduring heritage. Secondly, they serve as Protector of Faith, upholding the tenets of righteousness and shielding the populace from spiritual and temporal threats. Thirdly,  justice flows from their throne; they adjudicate disputes, dispensing fairness and mercy according to divine law. Lastly,  the Sovereign, as shepherd to their flock, ensures prosperity through wise counsel and fostering of trade and welfare.

## Legacy & Succession

A monarchy's grandeur inheres not merely in the present reign, but in its unbroken lineage, a testament to enduring legacy. Succession, ordained by custom or decree, typically passes through primogeniture, ensuring continuity and minimizing discord. This hereditary line acts as a living chronicle, connecting generations and anchoring the realm in a timeless order.  Thus, each Monarch builds upon the foundation laid by their ancestors, a noble edifice reaching towards celestial heights.
