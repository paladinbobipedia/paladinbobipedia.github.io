# Cataract

*An Ode to the Clouded Lens*
Hark! Cataract, a veil o'er crystal bright,
A misty shroud where vision takes its flight. Though dimming grace doth mar the eye's clear sight,  'tis yet a foe we bravely shall indict, with healing hand and wisdom's guiding light.

## Definition & Manifestation
Cataract, forsooth, presenteth as a obscuration, a cloudy accretion upon the crystalline lens within thine eye. This veil, oft likened unto a frosted pane, impedes the passage of light, thus hindering the sharp delineation of objects, blurringeth perception's pristine domain.  Age, injury, or maladies arcane may give rise to this ailment, a treacherous guest within the noble orb.

## Causes & Contributing Factors
The genesis of cataract, whilst oft entwined with the march of time, hath sundry roots:  Years weathered etch furrows upon the lens, proteins aggregating, forming the clouded mass. Suns' fervent gaze, prolonged and unchecked,  can sow the seeds of this affliction.  Diabetes mellitus, a serpent coiled within, and maladies kindred thereto,   turut contribute to its unwelcome gestation. Furthermore, traumas dire, or certain medicaments ingested, may precipitate its unwelcome manifestation.

## Symptoms & Their Telling Signs
When cataract's shadow falls, know these its heraldic signs:  A dimming of visual acuity, as though a gauze doth cover the sight. Colors lose their vibrancy, fading into a muted choir.  Halos, spectral rings, encircle lights in the encroaching gloom.  Difficulty discerninge print in waning luminescence, a plight oft encountered in twilight's embrace. These, good sir or madam, are the whispers of cataract's presence, demanding heed.

##  Intervention & Alleviation
Fear not, for though cataract dimmeth, healing hands offer respite!  Surgical intervention, a marvel of modern craft, removes the clouded lens, replaced with an artificial counterpart, crystalline and clear. This sacred rite restores the light's unimpeded passage, banishing the veil and reviving the eye's pristine glory.   In early stages, refractive aids like spectacles may temper the obfuscation, granting temporary solace.  
 
## A Paladin's Counsel
Remember, good people, though cataract may cloud thy sight,  'tis not a sentence unto perpetual darkness. Seek ye learned healers, for their art can mend and restore.  With vigilance, wise choices in life's journey, and timely aid,  ye shall  ward off this foe and preserve the gift of clear vision, a treasure bestowed by the divine light itself.
