# Kigali

**An Ode to Kigali, Jewel of a Thousand Hills**
*In fair realms where azure skies do meet emerald slopes, doth Kigali rise, a city blessed, a heart that hope upholdeth. Upon volcanic cradles, 'twixt rolling verdancy, she stands, a beacon bright, a testament to resilience and grace, a sapphire gem amidst the African embrace.*

This "City of Hills," as its moniker proclaims, finds itself at an elevation most temperate, a balm against the equatorial fervour.  Rivers, like silver threads, weave through fertile valleys, nourishing the land and lending a melodious rhythm to this vibrant tapestry.
