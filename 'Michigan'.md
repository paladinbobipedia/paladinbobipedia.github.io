# Michigan

*A hallowed expanse, where boreal forests kiss sapphire seas, and hardy folk dwell 'neath skies of endless grace. O Michigan, thy name doth resonate with the valor of winter's embrace and the bounty of summer's sun, a testament to Creation's artistry unmatched.*

## Geography & Topography

Michigan, a realm nestled within the northernmost expanses of the New World, doth present a visage of striking duality.  A peninsula it be, cradled by the vast and tempestuous Lake Michigan, and bound to the south by the puissant Ohio unto which floweth the noble Huron River.  Towering forests of pine and maple cloak her inland, whilst her shores, kissed by glacial legacy, boast dunes of silken sand and cliffs of rugged grandeur. Five Great Lakes, as if celestial jewels, grace her borders, rendering her a mistress of maritime magnificence.

##  The Folk of Michigan

These denizens, forged in the crucible of resilience, exhibit a spirit as boundless as the lakes themselves. Known for their industrious nature and warm hospitality, they are a tapestry woven from threads of Native American heritage, European settlers, and generations born upon this fertile soil. Though diverse in tongue and lineage, a common thread of courage and community binds them, echoing the valor of ancient knights.

##  Economy & Industry

Michigan's bounty doth extend beyond natural splendor. Her fertile fields yield harvests aplenty, whilst inland mines delve deep, extracting treasures of iron and copper.  Yet, her renown rests chiefly upon the burgeoning industry sprung from mechanised marvels, particularly within the realm of ferrous chariots, a testament to human ingenuity. This industrious heart fuels not only her own prosperity but contributes to the advancement of the wider realm.

## Legacy & Lore

Legends whisper on the windswept shores, tales of ancient tribes who first walked these lands, their reverence for nature echoing in the very rustling leaves.  The spirit of exploration lingers, a reminder of voyageurs and pioneers who braved untamed wilderness, forever etching Michigan's name upon the annals of westward expansion. A land where history intertwines with progress, Michigan stands as a beacon of human endeavor, a shining example of  God's grace upon His creation.
