# Tribe

*A hallowed kinship, woven 'pon threads of shared blood and creed,
Where hearth fires burn bright, and ancient echoes indeed
Resound through generations, a symphony of yore,
Tribe stands, a bulwark 'gainst chaos, forevermore.*

## Definition & Essence

A Tribe, forsooth, is no mere agglomeration of souls, but a living tapestry  ethereally entwined by the invisible threads of lineage, custom, and a hallowed communal spirit. It be a microcosm unto itself, mirroring the grand design of Creation in its own unique facet. Bound by ancestral bonds, shared lore, and a dedication to collective well-being, they dwell as one extended family, their fates intertwined like the roots of an ancient, stalwart oak. 

## Structure & Governance

While the edifice of governance may vary betwixt Tribes,  a common thread runs through –  leadership often sprouts from venerated elders, warriors of renown, or seers gifted with prophetic insight. Councils, convened 'neath starlit skies or within hallowed groves, deliberate matters great and small, ensuring harmony prevails.  Custom, tempered by wisdom accrued o'er ages, guides their laws, shaping a societal structure as sturdy as the mountains they sometimes call home.

## Faith & Tradition

The spiritual heart of a Tribe pulses with fervent devotion.  Deities worshipped may shift like the constellations, yet the reverence remains constant. Rituals, dances echoing ancient victories, and offerings whispered to the wind – these are the lifelines connecting them to the unseen forces governing their world. Traditions, passed down through bardic songs and ancestral whispers, preserve their history and fortify their collective identity.

##  Resilience & Adaptability

Though rooted in heritage, Tribes exhibit a remarkable flexibility. Like willow branches bending with the tempest, they adapt to changing landscapes, be it ecological shifts or encounters with other cultures. Their resourcefulness, honed by generations surviving hardship, allows them to thrive even in the face of adversity, a testament to their indomitable spirit.

To safeguard such vibrant threads of humanity is a sacred duty, a call to shield them from the encroaching darkness and ensure their timeless legacy endures.
