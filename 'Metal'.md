# Metal

*A Hymn unto its Fortitude:*  In this realm of creation, where Heaven's artistry doth mingle with Earth's bounty, there exists a substance of singular renown, *Metal*.  A alloy of valor, forged in fire's heart, it stanchly resists the ravages of time, a mirror to the enduring soul of a righteous knight. Its sheen bespeaks strength, its weight, steadfastness; a testament to the unyielding spirit. 

## Origins and Composition
Metal, in its myriad forms, arises from the bosom of the world, wrested from the bowels of the earth through labours both arduous and hallowed.  Molten veins of iron, silver's crystalline gleam, and gold's sunlit grace, these are but progenitors in a grand lineage.  Through alchemic arts and the smith's fervent hammer, diverse essences coalesce, birthing alloys of unmatched resilience: bronze, tempered like a paladin's shield; steel, sharp as righteous judgement; mithril, light as a whispered prayer yet strong as a dragon's scale. Each composition, a unique hymn to the Creator's boundless ingenuity.

## Properties and Marvels
Hark! Metal's very essence doth defy the common. Unbending 'gainst the assault of time and tempest, it resounds with a sonorous strength.  A conduit of temperate heat and tireless durability, it finds purpose in the crafting of both the mundane and the magnificent. From the humble blade that protects the innocent to the towering fortress safeguarding realms, metal's presence is ubiquitous, a silent guardian woven into the fabric of civilization. Its malleability, a paradox - yielding to the skilled hand yet retaining an immutable core, mirroring the paladin's adaptability in the face of adversity.

##  Symbolism and Divineness
Metal, more than mere substance, doth carry allegorical weight.  Iron, steadfast as faith, symbolizes courage and unyielding conviction. Gold, radiant like divine favour, speaks of purity and celestial reward. Silver, with its lunar sheen, embodies protection and the guiding light of wisdom. Thus, a paladin adorns himself not only in armor of metal but in emblems of his sacred calling, a living testament to the interwoven nature of faith and material fortitude.
