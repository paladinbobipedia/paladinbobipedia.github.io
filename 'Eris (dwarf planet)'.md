# Eris (Dwarf Planet)

*An Ode to the Storm-Bringer afar, Eris, in shadowed realms thou dost reside,
A frosty queen, with orbit wide, Where icy secrets cosmically confide. Thy presence doth challenge, our ken to expand,
A dwarf amongst giants, yet power in hand.*

## Discovery and Nomenclature

In the year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Five, upon yon celestial tapestry, the astronomers did unveil Eris, a wanderer of most frigid clime, christened thus in honour of the Grecian goddess of discord and strife, fitting, forsooth, for a body which shook the very foundations of our planetary understanding.  Her discovery, wrought by the combined gaze of Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz,  propelled a reevaluation of what constitutes a full-fledged planet, leading to the formal categorization of "dwarf planet."

## Physical Characteristics

Eris, a glacial behemoth, doth cloak herself in a mantle of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices. Her diameter, albeit smaller than our own Luna,  approaches  2,326 kilometers, rendering her larger than Pluto, the erstwhile ninth planet.  A ruddy hue, tinged with reddish-brown, paints her frozen visage, hinting at tholins, complex organic molecules formed by solar radiation upon her icy plains. Eris spins upon her axis with a measured pace, completing a rotation in some 25.7 hours.

## Orbital Dance and Significance

In the distant reaches of the Solar System, beyond Neptune's sway, Eris embarks on a stately waltz, orbiting the Sun at an average distance of  96 astronomical units. Her elongated orbit, inclined relative to the ecliptic, speaks of a celestial history interwoven with gravitational interactions, a cosmic ballet choreographed by the titans of our solar neighborhood. The very existence and orbital characteristics of Eris played a pivotal role in the redefinition of planetary status,  underscoring the dynamic and complex nature of our cosmic home.

## Moons and Mysteries

Eris, in her solitary grandeur, is attended by a single known moon, Dysnomia, a name  echoing  the Grecian goddess of lawlessness, a fitting companion to the discordant queen herself. Further exploration of Eris and her retinue promises to unravel further secrets  concealed within the frigid depths of the Kuiper belt, enriching our comprehension of planetary formation and the outer solar system's enigmatic tapestry.
