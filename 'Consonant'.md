# Consonant

**An Ode unto the Pillars of Speech**
*Hear ye, gentle souls, and lend thine ears to Consonant's might,
A bedrock 'pon which vocal tapestry doth take its flight.  Without these steadfast sounds, our tongues would be forlorn,
Mute echoes in a cavern, speech forever torn.*

## Definition and Essence

Consonant, forsooth, is a speech-sound, a lingual pillar strong,  produced by constriction in the breath's passage, clear and long. Unlike its kindred, Vowel, which openess doth embrace, the Consonant doth shape and mold the very fabric of our phrase.  From guttural throbs to sibilant whispers, its forms diversify, lending texture and definition to the symphony of oratory.

## Categorization and Classification

To comprehend Consonant's vast array, 'tis wise to cleave it thus: by manner of articulation, we shall dissect:
* **Stops:**  A momentary seal, then burst forth, like thunder's crest (P, B, T, D, K, G).
* **Fricatives:**  Friction's gentle hiss, a whispering breeze's quest (F, V, Th, S, Z, etc.).
* **Affricates:**  A blended act, stop then fricative's embrace (Ch, J).
* **Nasals:**  Through nasal cavities, resonance doth chase (M, N, Ng).
* **Liquids:**  Smoothly flowing, like streams in verdant chase (L, R). 
* **Glides:**  Rounding vowels, a subtle, gliding grace (W, Y).

## Role in Language's Architecture

Consonants, the very frame upon which words are built with care, provide  structure, accent, and distinction rare. They mark the boundaries of syllables, lend weight and emphasis bold,  and weave the intricate patterns that stories unfold. Without their steadfast presence, language would be but a formless stream, lacking the consonants'  anchor, a linguistic dream. 


## Ever Vigilant Guardians of Meaning

Mark well, dear reader, consonants stand as sentinels true,  guardians of meaning, ever watchful and anew. They differentiate  "pat" from "bat,"  "thin" from "win,"  thus shaping the very fabric of comprehension within. So let us praise these sonic stones, essential and bright,  the Consonants,  pillars of language,  shining ever light.
