# Contact Lens

*A hymn unto the crystalline sphere, that doth upon the eye reside, banishing obfuscation, and granting vision clear and wide. A marvel wrought by mortal hand, a lens of grace, a sight's command, contact doth it make, a blessing grand.*

## Description and Function

Contact lenses, artifacts of singular ingenuity, are diminutive, transparent discs crafted of most pliable materials. These miniature orbs, fashioned to mimic the very shape of the eyeball, are positioned directly upon the iris, resting with ethereal lightness upon the ocular surface.  By interposing betwixt the incoming luminance and the crystalline lens inherent to the eye, they correct refractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness), bestowing upon the wearer acuity hitherto unachieved.  Furthermore, lenses designed to shield against harmful rays or alter chromatic perception exist, serving purposes both prophylactic and aesthetic.

##  Fabrication and Materials

The creation of these ocular wonders involves the alchemy of modern artifice.  Skilled artificers, wielding tools of precision, sculpt lenses from resilient yet supple substances. Polymeric gels, akin to enchanted glass in their clarity, are oft employed, as are crystalline composites infused with magical properties for enhanced durability.  Each lens is meticulously molded to individual eye contours, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit.

## Application and Removal

The placement of a contact lens upon the eye, a feat once deemed sorcery, is now a practiced ritual. Using implements both delicate and sanitized, the wearer gently manipulates the lens, coaxing it onto the iris with practiced ease.  Removal follows a similar, though reversed, procedure, ensuring the lens doth not forsake its protective embrace prematurely.   Training and instruction are vital to this art, preventing injury and maximizing comfort.

##  Blessings and Perils

Contact lenses, a boon to the visually impaired, unlock a world of clarity and broadened horizons. They liberate the wearer from cumbersome spectacles, granting unimpeded vision in myriad pursuits. However, heed be taken! Neglecting hygiene  in their handling may invite the ire of pestilence, thus regular cleansing and proper storage are paramount.  Moreover, prolonged wear without respite can strain the ocular tissues, reminding us that even marvels require measured use. Thus, let wisdom guide their application, and long may they serve as a testament to human ingenuity.
