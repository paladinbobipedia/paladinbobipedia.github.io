# Lion

*Hark, noble beast of gilded mane and heart aflame, Emblem of valor, strength thy very name doth proclaim!  Through verdant fields and sun-kissed savannas thou dost roam, A righteous hunter, guardian of thy earthly home.*

## Physical Description
The Lion, *Leo* in tongue of learned men, presents a spectacle most awe-inspiring.  A coat of burnished gold, like unto the setting sun, adorns its puissant frame. A mane, a regal cascade, flows forth 'pon its noble head, thicker in the male, a crown 'pon which valor doth reside.  Its limbs, sinewy and strong, speak of power unmatched,  and eyes, twin embers, pierce with ancient, knowing light. Claws, like honed obsidian, rend with dreadful grace, a testament to the hunter's instinct ever bright.

## Habitat and Kingdom
These lords of the plains, these kings uncrowned, inhabit realms wide and varied. From sun-scorched African wastes to Asian jungles deep, where shadows dance and secrets sleep, their roar echoes a dominion held.  They favor grasslands, savannas bathed in golden light,  where prey abounds and ancient hunting grounds ignite.

## Social Structure and Prowess
Lions dwell not in solitary grandeur, but in prides, familial bonds of strength. A matriarch leads, her wisdom guiding the hunt.  Young cubs, nurtured with fierce affection, learn the ways of the kill,  growing into hunters themselves beneath the watchful gaze of kin.  Their cooperative prowess is legend; a symphony of coordinated attack, bringing down beasts many times their size.

## Symbolism and Legacy
The Lion, more than beast, is an embodiment. Courage roars within its chest,  a symbol for chivalry and noble heart.  In ancient lore, it graces coats of arms, a badge of royalty and guardianship.  From philosophers to bards, its image inspires,  a timeless testament to  untamed spirit and  boundless might.   Thus, the Lion endures, a beacon in the tapestry of creation.
