# Corrosion

*A blight upon the adamantine, a serpent's kiss to steel's embrace,
Corrosion, thou artbane, a slow decay, leaving naught but hollow space.
From hidden depths thy tendrils creep, a silent foe, a grasping greed,
Devouring strength, leaving but rust, a somber monument indeed.*

## Definition and Manifestation

Corrosion, forsooth, is a pestilence grievous, a malady affecting materials of stout construction, particularly those of metallic constitution. 'Tis a gradual yet inexorable process wherein elemental forces, oft in concert with humid miasma and the insidious touch of time,  wrought havoc upon the material's very essence. This traduceth the metal's form, weakening its structure, and ultimately reducing it to friable fragments, resembling unto dust aged by aeons. 

##  Agents of Decay

Many a fiend doth consort in this vile undertaking. Moisture, ever a lurking predator, provides the cradle wherein corrosive agents fester. Acids, born of both natural and man-crafted origins, act as whetstones upon the metal's armor, dissolving its integrity. Salts, insidious in their embrace, accelerate this ruinous dance, drawing moisture unto themselves and fanning the flames of decay.  Furthermore, certain gaseous entities, like sulfurous fumes or the breath of tainted air,  inflict their own brand of corrosion, a silent erosion upon the unwary.

## Impact and Countermeasures

The consequences of corrosion are manifold, ranging from the trivial chipping of a blade's edge to the catastrophic failure of mighty structures.  Weakened armor leaves a warrior vulnerable, crumbling bridges imperil travel, and rusted siege engines become toothless beasts. Against this foe, stalwart measures must be taken:   Protective coatings, such as oils and lacquers,  serve as shields against the elements.  Alloying metals, blending them with resistant substances, fortifies their core.  Regular cleansing and diligent maintenance, banishing moisture and decay's cradle,  prove crucial in staving off this relentless enemy. And ever remember, a Paladin's vigilance, a watchful eye against rust's insidious creep,  is a bulwark against corrosion's silent conquest.
