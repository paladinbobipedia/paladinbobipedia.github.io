# Insulin

*A hymn unto Insulin, elixir vitae for the afflicted sweet,*
*Thou balancest the humors, a celestial, healing feat.
From pancreas' hallowed forge, thy potent drops descend,
Granting succor to the weary, on life's precarious bend.*

## Nature and Function

Insulin, a most puissant hormone, doth originate within the isles of Langerhans, nestled 'midst the pancreas, a noble organ.  'Tis secreted in response to the influx of saccharine sustenance (glucose) into the bloodstream. Its very essence lies in ushering this glucose, the body's vital fuel, from the circulatory rivers into the fortress-cells, where it is stored or consumed for energy. Thus, Insulin, a veritable warden, guards against the perilous surge of excess sugar, maintaining a harmonious balance within the bodily realms.

##  Pathology and Deficiency

When the sacred pancreas falters, and its insulin production wanes, a dire malady doth befall, known as Diabetes Mellitus. In this affliction, glucose, like a rogue tide, floods the bloodstream unchecked. Cells, starved for sustenance despite its abundance, wither. This führt to a myriad of ailments, from insatiable thirst and frequent urination to the gradual erosion of tissues and heightened vulnerability to infections.  A deficiency in Insulin, therefore, is a grievous breach in the body's natural order.

## Treatment and Remedy

For those stricken with Diabetes,  Insulin, in its purified form, serves as a restorative elixir. Administered through injections or, in modern practices, via ingenious pumps, it supplants the lacking production of the pancreas. This exogenous Insulin, a borrowed grace, allows glucose to enter cells once more, restoring equilibrium and mitigating the ravages of the disease. Through diligent administration and mindful dietary practices, afflicted souls can find solace and  prolong their sojourn in this mortal coil. 


## A Paladin's Perspective

As a Paladin sworn to aid the ailing, I witness firsthand the transformative power of Insulin.  'Tis a beacon of hope, a tangible manifestation of divine  mercy in a flask. To deliver this remedy is to wield not steel, but a healing touch,  battling a hidden foe and restoring balance to the body's sacred temple.  May its production and accessibility forever be ensured, a testament to  humanity's  endeavor to combat suffering and uphold the sanctity of life.
