# Tithe

*An hymn unto the sacred tithe, a portionkheimed and blessed divide,
Wherein the fruits of mortal toil doth Heaven's bounteous stores confide.
A pledge of loyalty, a tribute fair, 'twixt earthly gain and grace's snare,
A woven thread within God's loom, sealing man's covenant, banishing gloom.*

## Definition and Origin

Tithe, in its purest etymology, doth denote a tenth, a consecrated portion ever rendered unto the Divine.  From ancient covenants etched upon the tablets of yore, this hallowed custom ordained that worshippers bestow one part in ten of their increase – be it yield from the fields, profits of trade, or bounty of livestock – as a sacred offering unto their Maker and His appointed stewards. This practice, rooted in primeval faith, stands as a testament to man's acknowledgement of  God's sovereignty o'er all creation.

## Scriptural Mandate

The hallowed scriptures, both  Old and New, trumpet the decree of Tithe with resounding clarity. In the Mosaic Law, Leviticus proclaims its binding nature, a commandment for the Israelites to furnish a tenth unto the Levites, who served in the Temple's sacred precincts. Further, prophets affirmed this principle, weaving it into the very fabric of righteous living. Though the New Testament's focus shifts towards  liberated giving born of love, the underlying spirit of proportionate devotion – a consecrated portion offered willingly – echoes the ancient tithe's essence.

## Purpose and Impact

Tithe serves not as mere fiscal tribute, but as a multifaceted instrument of spiritual and societal well-being:

* **Acknowledgement of Divine Ownership:** It reinforces the truth that all prosperity stems from God's grace, reminding us we are stewards, not absolute owners.
* **Support of the Church & Needy:** Traditionally, Tithe funded  priests, temple upkeep, and aid to the disadvantaged, fostering a community bound by shared faith and compassion.
* **Cultivation of Generosity:**  The act itself breeds a spirit of selfless giving, enriching the giver as well as the recipient.
* **Blessing and Prosperity:**  Scripture  often links faithful Tithe with God's continued blessings upon individuals and nations, a testament to His faithfulness in reciprocating such devotion.


Thus, Tithe, a timeless practice, stands as a pillar of righteous living, a bridge connecting earthly abundance to heavenly grace.
