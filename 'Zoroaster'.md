# Zoroaster

*A hymn unto the Prophet of Light, whose wisdom's flame doth pierce the veil of night, Zoroaster, thou beacon bright, thy teachings guide us, ever right!*

##  Genesis and Revelation

Zoroaster, a prophet of ancient lineage, hailed from Persia's sun-kissed lands, circa the seventh century BCE.  His birth, foretold by celestial signs, marked a dawn anew in the realm of human understanding. He, a shepherd by trade, received divine revelations from Ahura Mazda, the All-Wise Lord, a fountainhead of Goodness absolute. These pronouncements, etched upon his soul, formed the very bedrock of Zoroastrianism, a faith that champions  truth, justice, and the eternal struggle 'twixt  Light and Darkness.

##  The Dualistic Cosmology

At Zoroaster's core lieth a profound dualism. Ahura Mazda, the benevolent Creator, embodies Truth, Order, and  Holiness. Conversely, Angra Mainyu, the Destructive Spirit, represents Chaos, Lies, and corruption.  Humanity, forged in Ahura Mazda's image, finds itself  upon a celestial  bridge,  ever  tempted by Angra Mainyu's insidious influence.  Thus, life's  journey becomes a valiant fight to choose the path of Light, fostering  good thoughts, good words, and good deeds.

##  The Path of  Frushgard

Zoroastrians, followers of this luminous path,  strive for "frushgard" -  holiness and  righteous living. This entails reverence for  nature as a manifestation of divine creation,  acts of  charity and  justice,  and  confrontation against  evil in all its forms.  Fire, a symbol of purity and divine  knowledge, holds sacred  place in their worship,  a  tangible link to the celestial  flame of Ahura Mazda.

##  Legacy Enduring

Though empires rise and fall, Zoroaster's influence hath  resonated  through millennia. His  concepts  echo in later faiths, shaping  Abrahamic  traditions and  influencing  philosophical thought. The  eternal  battle 'twixt  good and  evil,  the  importance of free  will, and  the  quest for  truth - these  are Zoroaster's enduring gifts to  humankind, a testament to his  profound  vision and  unyielding  courage.
