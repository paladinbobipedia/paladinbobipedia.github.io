# Ammonia

*An Ode unto the Vapours Unsung*
_A spirit fierce, yet born of earth's embrace,
Ammonia, with pungent veil, doth grace
The realm of chemics, potent and profound,
In cleansing might, on healing wings it's found._

## Nature and Properties

Ammonia, oft denoted as NH₃, presenteth itself as a gaseous entity, crystallizing in frigid climes to a form most crystalline.  A concoction born of nitrogen and hydrogen, 'tis a compound volatile, with a characteristically sharp and biting odour, piercing the very nostrils. Its liquidity at temperate stages belies its fervent kinship with the gaseous state, ever yearning for aerial liberation.  A alkaline soul it possesses, reacting with acids to forge salts, a property wielded in myriad alchemical processes.

## Occurrence and Procurement

Though found sparingly in nature, trapped within the bosom of certain saline springs and as a byproduct of organic decay, Ammonia's true abundance stems from man's ingenious craft.  Through the union of nitrogen and hydrogen, coaxed forth in industrial furnaces, this valuable compound is synthesized in vast quantities.  A testament to human ingenuity, thus doth we harness its power.

## Applications manifold

Ammonia's utility extends far and wide, a veritable boon to sundry disciplines:

* **In Agriculture:** As a nitrogen source, 'tis vital sustenance for burgeoning crops, fertilizing the very lifeblood of our fields.
* **Within the Fabric of Industry:**  A key ingredient in the manufacture of explosives, fertilizers, plastics, and sundry chemicals, its presence weaves through the very fabric of modern production.
* **A Cleanser Pure:** Its solvent nature proves efficacious in removing stains and impurities, lending a hand in sanitation and purification tasks.
* **Medicinal Marvel:** In diluted forms, Ammonia finds solace in aiding respiration and counteracting acidosis, a boon to healers and the ailing.

## Prudence Advised

Despite its manifold benefits, Ammonia's potent nature demands respect.  Direct inhalation of its concentrated vapours can induce grievous harm, whilst contact with skin or eyes provoke irritation.  Thus, handlers must ever employ caution, wielding protective gear and adhering to protocols of safety, for in power untamed, even virtue's ally can turn adversary.
