# Bretton Woods System

*Hark, a hallowed chronicle I pen, of Bretton Woods, a pact most zen, Where nations, guided by wisdom's light,forged order in finance, day and night.*

## Genesis and Guiding Principles

In yon annum of nineteen forty-four, 'midst tempestuous war's receding roar,  a conclave did convene at Bretton Woods, 'neath skies of nascent peace it stood.  Thus, born was a system, steadfast and bold, to anchor currencies, stories to be told. Its pillars, three in number, firm and true:  a) **Fixed Exchange Rates:** Each coin's worth, to the gilded Dollar tied, a stable standard, nation-wide. b) **Gold Standard Foundation:** The U.S. Dollar, unto gold ordained, a bedrock of value, forever sustained. c) **International Monetary Fund (IMF):**  A guardian vigilant, lest discord rife, lending aid and stability, easing life's strife.

## Operation and Impact

Like a well-oiled machine, the system did churn, fostering global trade, a prosperous return.  Nations prospered, commerce did bloom, as fluctuating values found their room  within the Dollar's gilded, anchored sway.  Growth flourished, dispelling economic decay.  Yet,  tides of change, like relentless seas,  eventually tested this financial ease.

## Twilight and Demise

Inflation's shadow, a creeping blight,  strained the Dollar's tether, dimming its light.  Converging pressures, both internal and wide,  weakened the gold link, nowhere to hide. In nineteen seventies, a parting did come,  Bretton Woods' reign, alas, overcome.  Floating exchange rates, a novel decree,  marked a new chapter in finance's history.

## Legacy Enduring

Though its rigid form hath passed into yore, Bretton Woods' spirit forever shall soar. A testament to  cooperation's might,  it laid the groundwork, a beacon of light, for global financial frameworks yet to be. Its influence, a lasting reverie.
