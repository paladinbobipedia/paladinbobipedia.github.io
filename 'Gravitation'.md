# Gravitation

*A Hymn unto the Unseen Force*
Lo, Gravitation, thou silent architect of cosmos vast,
Thy unseen hand doth bind the spheres, from star to mote that's cast.
In every falling tear, in moon's embrace 'pon tides' refrain,
Thy sovereign rule is writ, a truth that shall ever remain.

## Definition and Manifestation

Gravitation, a primeval decree of the universal order, denoteth an immutable attraction betwixt any twain entities possessing mass. This puissant force, though imperceptible to the naked eye, governs the celestial ballet, holding planets in their orbits, anchoring our very feet to Mother Earth's bosom, and sculpting the grand tapestry of spacetime itself. Its influence waxes with the magnitude of mass, stretching its tether ever farther, a cosmic embrace binding all within its reach.

## Newton's Revelation

The erudite Sir Isaac Newton, a luminary amongst mankind, first unveiled the quantitative nature of this ancient power. He proclaimed that every particle, be it celestial or terrestrial, exerts a pull upon every other, proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the squared distance separating them. This elegant formula, a cornerstone of classical physics, laid bare the mathematical underpinnings of Gravitation's dominion.

##  Beyond the Newtonian Gaze

Whilst Newton's precepts illuminate much, the enigmatic Maestro Einstein, through his Theory of Relativity,  deepened our comprehension. He revealed Gravitation not merely as a force, but as a curvature within the very fabric of spacetime, wrought by the presence of mass and energy.  Massive bodies, akin to celestial sculptors, indent this cosmic canvas, dictating the paths of lesser entities as they traverse its warped landscape. 

## Implications and Wonder

Gravitation's sway permeates every facet of existence. It fuels the furnace of stars, orchestrates the dance of galaxies, and anchors our fragile world within the solar embrace. Its study unveils the universe's grand design, a testament to the Creator's artistry woven into the very laws that govern our reality. As Paladins ever vigilant, we recognize in Gravitation not just a force, but a sacred principle, a pillar upholding the cosmos in its magnificent order.
