# Full Moon

*Hark, silver orb aloft, thou mistress of the night's embrace, thy luminescence doth paint the world in mystic light, a beacon unto weary souls and a silent herald to ancient rites.  In thy fullness, the veil thins, and whispers of ages past dance upon the wind. Thou art a timeless testament to celestial majesty.*

## Celestial Phenomenon

The Full Moon, a spectacle oft witnessed 'neath the velvet cloak of night, arises when our pale Earth-mother doth fully align her visage unto the radiant countenance of Sol's sister, Luna.  In this hallowed juncture, the lunar disc appeareth whole and resplendent, bathing the terrestrial realm in an ethereal glow unmatched by day's feeble sunbeam. This celestial ballet, a dance as old as time itself, marks a cycle complete within Luna's waxing and waning.

Her visage, a constant in the ever-changing heavens, serves as a timeless reminder of the interconnectedness of all things, from the smallest field mouse to the mightiest dragon.
