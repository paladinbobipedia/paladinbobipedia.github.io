# Tetanus

*An ill most foul, Tetanus, doth grip with iron hand, twisting flesh and spirit 'neath its cruel command. A serpent's venom, though not of scales nor fang,  it strikes where wounds reside, a lingering, horrid pang.*

## Origins and Nature

Tetanus, a malady borne of miasma dark, festering in soils where corruption doth embark. Aspawned from spores of *Clostridium tetani*, a fiend invisible to the naked eye, 'tis bred in rust and decay, where cleanliness doth die.  This insidious blight, when wounds unsanctioned bear, insinuates its way, a torment most unfair.  It commandeers the nerves, a tyrant in its hold, inducing rigid spasms, a story oft been told.

## Manifestations, Dreadful to Behold

Upon the afflicted, symptoms grimly rise, a symphony of agony 'neath pained, imploring skies. Muscles stiffen, lock in tortured embrace,  a vice-like grip that steals both comfort and grace. The jaw, a clenched fist,  speech becomes a strain,  while swallowing, a Herculean task,  a tormenting bane.  Headache's hammer pounds, a fever's fierybrand,  and  breathing, a labored gasp, doth sorely strand.

## Paladin's Purview: Combat and Cure

Though Tetanus stalks with stealth, a Paladin shall stand,  armed not just with blade, but wisdom  God hath planned.  First, prevention, a bulwark strong and true, vaccination, a shield 'gainst this venomous crew.  Wounds cleansed with fervent care, a sacred rite,  minimize the portal where this demon might  intrude.  Should the affliction grip, a healer's art doth aid,  antitoxin, a lance 'gainst Tetanus' deadly raid.  Rest, nourishment, and solace, a comforting hand,  for in body and spirit, healing must expand. 

## A Word to the Faithful

Fear not this pestilence, though grim its visage be,  for with vigilance and faith,  victory shall we see.  Let cleanliness be our armor, vaccination our  guard,  and  in healers' skilled hands,  relief shall be awarded. Through God's grace and valor, Tetanus shall  be tamed,  and  life's precious flame, forever untarnished, proclaimed.
