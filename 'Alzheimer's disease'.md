# Alzheimer's Disease

*A plague upon the hallowed halls of memory, a thief in the night doth steal the mind's bright tapestry, leaving behind a desolate landscape of forgotten lore. Woe unto those afflicted, for Alzheimer's, a grievous malady, erodes the very essence of self, a cruel paradox where presence lingers, yet the soul doth wander lost.*

## Description & Manifestations

This insidious affliction, Alzheimer's disease, besets the aged and venerable, a shadow cast upon the twilight years.  'Tis marked by a gradual, inexorable dimming of cognitive faculties. Remembrance, that beacon guiding mortal passage through time, flickers and fades. Names, faces, cherished moments – all slip through grasping fingers like sand 'pon an hourglass. Speech, once fluent, stumbles and withers, whilst comprehension wanes, leaving sufferers in a labyrinth of their own minds.  A heavy cloak of confusion descends, shrouding the afflicted in a fog of disorientation, a tormenting estrangement from their former selves.

## Causes & Genesis

Though the precise genesis of this melancholy plague remains shrouded in mystery, learned physicians posit that  abnormalities within the brain, namely amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles,  play a dire role. These insidious formations choke the delicate pathways of neurons, disrupting communication and ultimately leading to their demise.  Age, alas, stands as a potent predisposing factor, increasing vulnerability with the passing of years.  Genetic lineage, too, may weave a thread of susceptibility, though its influence is oft intertwined with the vagaries of fate.

## Path & Prognosis

Alzheimer's disease, a relentless adversary, advances in stages. Early on, subtle lapses in memory occur, dismissed as mere forgetfulness.  Progression, however,  is inexorable. Reasoning and judgment falter,  daily tasks become arduous, and personality shifts may manifest. Eventually,  complete dependence upon caregivers ensues, a poignant reminder of the mind's fragility. Regrettably,  a cure eludes our grasp at present.  Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, easing suffering, and providing solace to both patient and their devoted attendants. The prognosis, a somber truth,  is one of gradual decline, a fading ember until the final, peaceful slumber.

## A Paladin's Plea

While medicine strives for a balm, let us, as beacons of compassion, offer unwavering support to those ensnared by this affliction. Treat them with the dignity and reverence due to every soul, remembering the indomitable spirit that yet flickers within, even as the outer light dims.  Be a shield against despair, a guiding hand in their twilight,  for in empathy and care,  we find a measure of solace amidst this grievous malady.
