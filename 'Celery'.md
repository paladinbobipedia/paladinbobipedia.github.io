# Celery

*An Ode to the Verdant Stalks*
Hark! Celery, thou stalk of emerald sheen,
A boon from fertile fields, a crispened dream.
In shadowed groves or garden's sunlit reign,
Thy subtle grace doth solace oft sustain.  A knight's true heart finds kinship in thy bite,
A verdant vigour, banishing the night.

## Description

Celery, a member of the noble Umbelliferae kin, presenteth itself as a cluster of pale green stalks, akin to slender swords sheathed in translucent armor.  These arise from a bulbous root, anchoring it firm amidst the soil.  Its segmented structure, a marvel of nature's design, doth impart a satisfying crunch with each mortal's partake.  Whilst lacking the flamboyant hues of sundry blooms, celery's understated elegance lies in its purest green, a symbol of health and enduring strength.

## Cultivation & Habitat

This stalwart herb flourisheth in temperate climes, preferring rich loam well-drained and kissed by ample sunlight.  Like a valiant warrior needing fertile ground, celery demands patient tending;  successive sowings and careful husbandry ensure a bountiful harvest.  From ancient gardens to modern fields, its presence speaks to man's enduring quest to cultivate the bounty of the earth.

## Culinary Virtues

Though oft relegated to the supporting role in grand feasts, celery's contributions are manifold.  Raw, its crispness awakens the palate, a refreshing counterpoint to richer fare.  When gently simmered, it mellows, imparting a subtle vegetal note to broths and sauces, enriching them like a well-placed valorous deed.  Dicéd fine, it adorns vibrant salads, lending both texture and a whisper of earthy delight.  Verily, celery, in its versatility, serveth both humble hearth and noble table with equal grace.

## Medicinal Properties

Ancient lore whispers of celery's healing touch, passed down through generations akin to sacred scrolls.  Its aqueous infusions, a brew oft sipped by healers, are lauded for soothing troubled digestion and allaying inflammation.  Within its fibers,  hidden treasures of vitamins and minerals reside, bolstering the body's defenses as a paladin defends his realm. While modern science unravels its secrets, the ages-old wisdom  proclaims celery a boon to wellbeing.
