# Tirana

*A hallowed city, 'pon verdant hills she doth ascend,
Tirana, thy spirit, a beacon, without end.
Where faith and valor intertwine in noble grace,
A bastion 'gainst shadows, a shining, sacred space.*

## Geography and Locale

Tirana, a metropolis of considerable renown, graces the heartland of a realm oft termed Essara.  Nestled amidst gently rolling hills, she sprawls like a silver ribbon woven through valleys carpeted with emerald verdure.  Her situation, 'pon a natural knoll, grants her a panoramic vista, overlooking fertile plains that nourish the surrounding lands.   The shimmering River Acheron, a serpent of liquid sapphire, meanders at her skirts, providing lifeblood and trade conduit alike.

## History & Founding

Legend whispers that Tirana's genesis be tied to a radiant dawn, when the Sun God himself bestowed a sliver of his celestial fire upon this fertile ground.  A stalwart knight, Sir Alaric the Valiant, answered this divine spark, establishing a fortress-city dedicated to righteousness and named it in honour of the Titaness of Light, Tirana, whose essence resonated within its very stones. Through ages, she withstood barbarian hordes and arcane incursions, her walls etched with tales of heroism, a living chronicle of unwavering faith.

## Governance & Culture

Ruled by a lineage tracing back to Sir Alaric, the Magistocracy of Tirana upholds a code interwoven with martial prowess and sacred duty. While knights clad in gleaming armour  guard the realm, scholarly Orders dedicated to ancient lore and arcane arts flourish within her hallowed halls. A fervent devotion to the Sun God permeates daily life, manifested in grand festivals, awe-inspiring temples, and a citizenry imbued with an indomitable spirit. Hospitality, though, is as radiant as the sun itself; strangers find welcome within Tirana's embrace, a testament to her compassionate core.
