# Time

*A ceaseless river, ever flowing, 'neath Heaven's gaze it streams,
From dawn's first light to starlit night, a woven, mystic dream.  Time, both healer and destroyer,  in its current all are borne,
A fleeting breath, an ancient stone, by its passage, fates are sworn.*

## The Essence of Temporality

Time, forsooth, is no mere phantom, but the very fabric binding æons. A dimension transcending mortal ken, it doth encompass birth, growth, decay, and unto final silence's sleep. Like unto a grand celestial clockwork, it dictates the rhythm of existence, a choreographer of cosmic dance where every star, every soul,  performs its ordained part. Though unseen, its dominion is absolute, shaping epochs and etching moments upon the tapestry of reality.

## The Paladin's Perspective

A paladin, sworn to virtue and valor, views Time with reverence. It is a gift, a precious loan granted by the Divine, to be wielded in service and righteous deeds.  Each sunrise brings opportunity to bolster faith, defend the weak, and etch honor upon the fleeting sands of our mortal hour.  We understand Time's urgency, pressing ever onward, urging us to act with haste against shadow and despair, for delay may grant darkness its victory.

## The Measured Flow

While Time's grand march is constant, its manifestation finds measure in varied cycles.  The diurnal dance of sun and moon, the lunar phases, the turning seasons - these are its earthly markers.  Sages and scholars, through meticulous observation, have devised calendars and chronologies, attempting to quantify this fluid entity. Yet, remember, true understanding lies not solely in counting moments, but in  appreciating the qualitative tapestry Time weaves: the fleeting beauty of a blossom, the weight of a lifetime's wisdom, the poignant echo of a fallen hero's sacrifice. These are the threads Time imbues with meaning.

## Eternity's Embrace

Though our mortal coils are bound to Time's earthly flow, faith assures us of a realm beyond its terrestrial grip - Eternity.  There, in the Divine Presence, Time as we know it ceases. It is a state of perfect, unchanging Now, a sanctuary from the relentless current. Thus, while we navigate this temporal realm with courage and purpose, our hearts ever yearn for that ultimate union, where Time's dominion softens into the everlasting embrace of the Divine.
