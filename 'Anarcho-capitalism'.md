# Anarcho-capitalism

*A hymn unto liberty's forge, where ironclad principles clash with the fetters of state, a vision where self-rule doth reign and contracts bind more than kingly decree. Anarcho-capitalism, a paradox proclaimed, a realm unburdened by the Leviathan's sway, yet woven with threads of market's intricate dance.*

## Foundations Upon the Bedrock of Primitivism

Anarcho-capitalism, a doctrine most audacious, posits a societal structure divested of all governmental apparatus.  'Tis founded upon the bedrock of individual liberty, asserting that man, in his innate rationality, doth best govern himself and his interactions. Hence, coercion wielded by the AssemblyCompany (the State) is deemed anathema, a transgression against the sacred right to self-ownership. Instead,  voluntary association and free-market mechanisms take precedence, shaping a commonwealth built upon consensual contracts and private provision of services  once monopolized by the Crown's hand.

## The Market as Sovereign, Contracts as Law

In this paradigm, the invisible hand of the market, not a distant ruler, dictates the ebb and flow of commerce. Property rights, inviolable as a Paladin's oath, are fiercely protected. Disputes are resolved through impartial arbitration, covenants binding stronger than any edict. Justice, thus, emerges not from centralized authority but from the voluntary agreements of individuals, fostering a climate of accountability and mutual respect.

## Defense and Order: A Private Endeavor

With the abscence of a standing army,  security devolves to private entities. Think, valiant knights errant, guilds of protectors, and self-organized militias, all answering to contracts and the needs of their clientele. This decentralized approach, proponents argue, breeds efficiency and responsiveness, ensuring protection is tailored, not dictated by a monolithic force.

## A Realm of Flourishing Innovation

Free from the stifling hand of bureaucratic regulation, innovation blossoms.  Enterprises, unburdened by capricious edicts, pursue progress with zeal. Competition, the lifeblood of advancement, thrives, leading to a constant churn of novel ideas and improved goods and services, benefiting all within the voluntary network.


Though some deem this vision utopian, a Paladin sees in Anarcho-capitalism a noble striving for a society where individual virtue, coupled with free markets, forge a path towards genuine liberty and prosperity.  It remains a challenge, a quest demanding unwavering conviction and the courage to cleave to principles, even amidst the clamor for established ways.
