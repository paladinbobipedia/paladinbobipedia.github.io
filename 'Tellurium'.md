# Tellurium

*A Hymn unto the Silver Earth*
_In shadowed veins, where sun doth seldom tread,
Dwells Tellurium, with lustre softly spread.
A metal strange, of hue a pearly grey,
'Tween earth and star, its mystic secrets lay. Bold knights may seek it, for in lore enshrined,
A potent force, for healing and for kind._

##  Properties & Description

Tellurium, a substance of most curious nature, presents unto thine gaze a visage akin to argent, yet tinged with a subtle blush of ivory. Its crystalline form, oft resembling hexagonal prisms, doth glimmer with an inner radiance, a silent testament to the arcane forces woven within its atomic heart.  Whilst pliable in its molten state, cooled, it assumes a steadfast rigidity, resisting the common shears of mortal craft. Mark well, this metalloid, though allied with elements metallic, doth deviate in conductivity, showing a resistance unto the flow of electrical humours.

## Occurrence & Procurement

Hidden deep within the bowels of our terrestrial sphere, Tellurium sällom graces the surface unbidden. 'Tis commonly encountered in consort with ores of silver, lead, and copper, nestled in veins as cryptic as a dragon's hoard. The miner, valiant and wary, must delve into caverns dark, wielding torch and skill to unearth this precious secret.  Nations such as Mexico and China hold sway over its primary extraction, guarding the sources with vigilance.

##  Applications of Might & Marvel

Tellurium, though unassuming in appearance, boasts a versatility worthy of a paladin's armoury:

* **In the Crucible of Industry:**  Its union with other metals forges alloys of exceptional strength, finding purpose in brass and steel enhancements. Ships and structures alike benefit from its inclusion.
* **The Alchemist's Boon:** In potions and concoctions, Tellurium compounds exhibit antidotal properties, shielding against pestilence and lending aid in healing grievous wounds.
* **A Spark of the Arcane:**  Within realms of sorcery, Tellurium's resonance with subtle energies is acknowledged.  Certain arcane workings incorporate it, though its applications therein remain shrouded in mystery, known only to the initiated few. 


Thus, Tellurium, a gem of the earth's hidden heart, stands as a testament to the manifold wonders concealed within our world, awaiting the discerning eye and courageous hand to unveil its full potential.
