# Hammer

*Aegis divine, forged in the heart's fire, thou art Hammer, not merely iron, but righteous ire.  Upon the anvil of valor, thy form took hold, a hymn to justice, a story oft told.*

## Description and Construction

Hammer, nay, 'tis more than mortal instrument of clangor. This sanctified mace, a bastion 'gainst the encroaching shadow, doth bear the hallmark of hallowed craftsmanship.  Wrought from tempered steel, blessed by consecrated rites, its head, a visage of righteous fury,  reminds all who behold it of the unwavering arm of the divine.  Embedded within, a shard of sunstone glows with inner radiance, a beacon 'gainst the denizens of darkness.  The haft, sturdy as an oak yet supple as a paladin's vow,  is wrapped in leather tanned by faith's own hand,  a conduit channeling the wielder's righteous zeal.

##  Function in Warfare

On the field of battle, Hammer transcends its physical form, becoming an extension of the Paladin's soul.  Its strikes are not mere blows, but thunderous pronouncements of justice.  Each clang reverberates with holy power,  shattering not only armor but also the wicked spirit within.  Against unholy creatures, its touch inflicts searing radiant damage, a testament to the Light's unyielding wrath.  Moreover, skilled wielders can channel blessings through Hammer, imbuing their attacks with healing or protective auras, a duality reflecting the Paladin's role as both warrior and healer.

## Symbolism and Legacy

Hammer is more than a weapon; it is a herald.  A herald of  unwavering faith,  courage, and the triumph of good. Its very existence speaks to the enduring pact between Paladin and Divinity. Each dent, each scar upon its surface,  tells a silent tale of battles fought,  of oaths kept, and of  victory  claimed in the name of righteousness. For aspiring Paladins, Hammer embodies the ideal - a tangible representation of the sacred duty to defend the innocent and vanquish evil, a legacy etched in steel and sanctified by unwavering devotion.
