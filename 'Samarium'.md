# Samarium

*A hymn unto Samarium, metal of mystic might,
Whereth ancient earth doth gleam with silver-hued light.
In dragon's hoard 'tis seldom found, a gem most rare,
Yet blessings manifold upon its touch doth bear.*

##  Physicochemical Properties

Samarium, a noble metal of the lanthanide kin, doth shimmer with an argent hue, akin to polished moonlight.  Its atomic visage, denoted as Sm,  carries the number sixty-two upon the celestial chart of elements. A member of the rare earth tribe, 'tis found in nature entwined with its brethren, seldom in isolation. Possessing a density surpassing that of lead, Samarium exhibits a crystalline structure, hexagonal in form, a testament to the order ingrained within its very being.  Whiles ductile and malleable 'neath gentle hand, 'tis resistant to corrosion, standing firm against the ravages of time and elements.

##  Extraction and Procurement

From the bowels of the earth, Samarium doth emerge,  extracted primarily through a process known as  "mineral separation".  Ores rich in monazite and bastnäsite, its earthly cradles, are first pulverized. Then, with artful manipulation of  chemical affinities,  Samarium is divorced from its companions, yielding a concentrate ripe for further refinement.  Subsequent stages involve electrolysis and refining fires, culminating in the pure metallic form, a beacon of radiant silver.

##  Marvels and Applications

Though scarce, Samarium's virtues find wide acclaim:

* **In Magnetism's Realm:** Compounds of Samarium, particularly with cobalt, forge magnets of exceptional potency, surpassing even those of iron. These  "samarium-cobalt" magnets grace devices requiring unwavering strength, from aerospace marvels to medical instruments.
* **Illumination's Embrace:**  Samarium doped crystals, when activated by  excitation, emit light of a vivid crimson hue. This luminescence finds purpose in lasers,  serving in scientific research and  medical procedures.
* **Nuclear Guardian:**  Isotopes of Samarium, blessed with neutron-absorbing qualities, play a vital role in safeguarding nuclear reactors, mitigating uncontrolled fission.


Thus, Samarium, a metal of subtle power, stands as a testament to the wonders hidden within our terrestrial realm,  a boon to both  science and  civilization's progress.
