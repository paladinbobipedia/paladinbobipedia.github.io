# Kidney

*A hymn unto the Bean of Might, Two-fold in form, a stalwart knight within the Citadel of Man, filtering the ichor, purging taint, and lending life's enduring span.*

## Anatomical Description
This puissant organ, oft dubb'd "Kidney," presenteth itself in twin fashion, nestled upon either flank nigh unto the spinal column's regal guard.  Of a reddish-brown hue, resembling polished onyx, 'tis bean-shaped in silhouette, a testament to its industrious nature. Within its fibrous fortress lie intricate networks of nephrons, microscopic sieves that orchestrate the vital task of blood refinement.

## Function Most Noble
The Kidney, a veritable alchemist of the corporeal realm, serves as the sovereign purifier of the humours.  Through a process most arcane, it sifts the coursing blood, extracting waste products and surplus waters, fashioning therefrom a liquid refuse known as urine. This purging act maintains the body's equilibrium, a delicate dance 'twixt nourishment and expulsion, ensuring the fluidity and purity essential to life's perpetuation.

## Guardian of Harmony
Beyond its filtration prowess, the Kidney plays a pivotal role in hematopoiesis, the creation of erythrocytes, those red steeds that carry life's breath through the veins. Moreover, it doth regulate blood pressure, a steadfast sentinel against surges and drops, and  maintains the balance of electrolytes, vital minerals crucial to myriad bodily functions. Thus, the Kidney stands as a pillar of internal harmony.

##  Reverence and Care
As a bastion of health, the Kidney demands respect and mindful stewardship.  A temperate lifestyle, abstaining from excess and embracing wholesome fare, doth honour its service.  Regular introspection through urine analysis, and prompt counsel from learned physicians when maladies arise,  are acts of piety towards this noble organ. For in safeguarding the Kidney, we safeguard the very temple of our being.
