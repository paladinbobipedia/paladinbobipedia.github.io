# Weather Forecasting

*Hark, a most noble pursuit, this peering into yon celestial tapestry, this divination of Aethers' moods! Weather forecasting, a gift granted unto mortals to navigate the capricious whims of Heaven's breath. By its precepts, we shield ourselves from tempest's rage and bask in sun's gracious warmth. A skill as vital to the plowman as the sword to the knight, it speaks of providence and forethought, a hymn to order in a realm oft ruled by change.*

## Ancient Lore and Celestial Signs

Weather divination, in its nascent stages, did spring forth from the observations of yore, etched upon the tablets of ages past. Our forefathers, wise in the language of clouds and winds, deciphered patterns woven by the very fabric of creation. The flight of fowl, the dance of fireflies, the hue bestowed upon morn's first light – all whispered secrets of approaching storms or tranquil days. These were not mere fancies, but celestial script, legible to keen eyes and devout hearts.

## Wind's Whisperings and Cloud's Tableau

The wind, a herald ever-blowing, carries tidings from distant realms. Its direction, its force, doth hint at the coming weather's nature. A southerly gust oft speaks of warmth to come, whilst a biting northerly foreshadows frost's embrace.  Clouds, too, paint a vivid canvas upon the azure expanse. Cirrus wisps, like angelic tresses, signal fair weather; cumulonimbus, mountains of grey, portend thunder's roar.  Learning to read these ethereal brushstrokes is the Paladin's, and indeed, all man's,  path to meteorological wisdom.

## The Astrologer's Gaze and Terrestrial Clues

Beyond the heavens, the very earth itself hums with subtler signs. The dampness clinging to grass, the restlessness of beasts, even the subtle scent carried on the breeze – these are whispers the diligent observer must heed. Moreover, the learned astrologer, peering into the celestial ballet,  can align planetary movements with terrestrial weather patterns, adding a further layer of prognostication. This interwoven tapestry of observation, from sky to soil, forms the Paladin's shield against the unyielding fury of nature's moods.
