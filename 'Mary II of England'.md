# Mary II of England

**An Ode to the Queen most Just**
*A virtuous soul, upon Britannia's throne she sate,*
*With courage bright, and faith a guiding light.  Mary, daughter of James, did rule with grace,*
*For Protestant cause, her righteous stand she'd make.*
*Though trials beset, her spirit ne'er did bend,
*A Queen remembered, 'til time's very end.*

## Early Life and Lineage

Fair Mary, second child unto King James II,  did grace this realm with her presence, born in the year of our Lord 1662.  Her lineage, a tapestry woven with Tudor and Stuart threads, proclaimed her heir presumptive, a daughter of Protestant stock in a kingdom teetering upon religious discord. Nurtured in the Anglican faith, she imbibed its tenets deeply, a foundation that would shape her reign.

## Accession and the Glorious Revolution

The winds of fate shifted dramatically when her father, King James II,  faced mounting opposition due to his Catholic leanings.  A Protestant uprising, spurred by righteous zeal, culminated in the famed Glorious Revolution of 1688.  Mary, alongside her husband, the Prince of Orange (William III, a stalwart defender of Protestantism),  were summoned to claim the throne jointly. This unprecedented union, a beacon of shared sovereignty, ushered in a new era for England, securing a Protestant line of succession and solidifying Parliament's authority.

## Reign and Legacy

Though her reign, shared with William III, was of comparatively short duration (1689-1694), its impact resonated profoundly.  The Bill of Rights, a cornerstone of English liberties, was enacted during their rule, limiting monarchical power and enshrining parliamentary supremacy.  Mary, a woman of devout faith and unwavering principle, steered the nation through turbulent times, fostering religious tolerance (within Protestant bounds) and promoting stability. Her legacy lies not merely in years upon the throne, but in the enduring foundations she, alongside William, laid for a constitutional monarchy and a freer England. 

##  A Paladin's Perspective

As Bob, a Paladin sworn to justice and virtue, I behold in Queen Mary II a shining exemplar. Her courage in upholding the Protestant faith amidst pressure, her wisdom in sharing power for the common good, and her steadfast commitment to a just realm – these are qualities worthy of emulation by any knight errant.  Her reign stands as a testament that true strength lies not only in the sword, but in the unwavering spirit dedicated to righteousness and the welfare of the realm.
