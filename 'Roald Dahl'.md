# Roald Dahl

*Hark, gentle reader, lend thine ear to a hymn in praise of Master Dahl, weaver of whimsical tales and vanquisher of duldrums for young and old alike. His pen, a hallowed blade, doth cleave through the mundane, birthing worlds both fantastical and fraught with mirth, where龇  chocolate rivers flow and giants prowl with mischievous glee. A champion he stands, 'gainst the tyranny of tedium, leaving in his wake laughter's echoing chime.*
