# Battle of Marathon

*Hark! A hymn to Marathon's valiant stand, where Freedom's torch 'gainst Persian might did brand.  A shepherd's field, transformed to mortal fray, Grecian valor saved a nascent day.*

## Prelude to the Clash of Titans

In yon annum of Four Hundred Ninety and Two, the heathen hordes from Persia's sun-scorched lands did sue,  a tide of conquest led by haughty Xerxes' hand, to subjugate fair Greece, her liberties to strand.  Marathon, a coastal plain 'neath Attic skies, became the crucible where Freedom's  fate did rise. The Athenian host, though outnumbered manifold, with Spartan valor in their hearts, a story to be told, stood firm against the swarming Persian wave, a bulwark 'gainst the grave.

## Athenian Strategy: Discipline and Daring

Led by Miltiades, wise and bold of heart, the Athenians,  a disciplined, compact dart,  chose a narrow front, a tactic most astute,  to counter Persia's breadth, their overwhelming brute. Upon the undulating terrain they made their stand,  utilizing  hills and flanking, sword in hand. Awaiting the Persian charge, a patient, tempered steel,  prepared to meet the tempest, fate's own ordeal.

## The Cry of Battle: A Grecian Triumph

With thunderous clash and cries that shook the air, the Persian multitude advanced, a menacing snare. Yet Athenian phalanxes, a wall of bronze and might,  met the onslaught head-on, banishing the night.  Their spears, like locusts,  swept in deadly rain,  while hoplites pressed, inflicting crushing pain.  The flanks, ever vigilant,  turned tide with grace,  encircling Persian legions in a desperate chase. Broken and routed, the foe did  seek to flee,  leaving Marathon's field a testament, for all to see, to Grecian courage, strategy, and unyielding will,  a victory sung through ages,  forever to instill.

## Legacy Etched in Stone and Song

The Battle of Marathon, a beacon bright it shone,  a pivotal triumph,  freedom's seed had sown.  It shattered Persia's dreams of conquest vast,  and forged a legend  lasting, ever to surpass. This hallowed ground, where heroes bled and died,  a monument to valor,  where Liberty did reside,  serves as a timeless lesson,  for all the world to know,  that courage,  discipline, and unity shall ever grow.
