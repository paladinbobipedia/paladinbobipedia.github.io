# Pound Sterling

*A hallowed coin, of ancient birth, doth grace our realm with steadfast worth, A lion rampant, fierce and bold, upon its face, a tale untold, Of empires past and futures bright, The Pound Sterling, shining light.*

##  Genesis and Heraldry

The Pound Sterling, a venerated denomination hailing from the Isles of Albion, traceth its lineage to a bygone era of Saxon coinage.  Initially,  a "pound" signified a weight of silver, equivalent to  circa eighty shillings. This weighty sum, marked with the puissant image of a lion rampant, became a symbol of royal decree and fiscal stability. Thus,  "Pound Sterling,"  a nomenclature  borne of both weight and the realm's Latin title ("Terra Sterilng"),  emerged as the bedrock of England's monetary system.

The introduction of banknotes,  witnessed in thegeoning commerce of the 17th century,  expanded its reach whilst preserving its intrinsic worth.
