# Howland Island

*A isle forlorn, yet 'pon Neptune's breast doth lie,
Whereropic winds and azure heavens sigh. Though scant of man's tread, 'tis Heaven's own lullaby,
A sanctuary wild, 'neath God's eternal eye.*

## Geographic Description

Howland Isle, a speck upon the vast ocean's tapestry, lieth some leagues unto the south-east of the mighty Gilbert Islands. 'Tis a coral atoll, ringed with sands white as driven snow, and cradled by a turquoise lagoon of surpassing beauty.  Though diminutive in size, scarce exceeding three square miles, its emerald verdant center doth harbour a surprising abundance of vegetation, testament to Nature's resilient hand. Ancient trees, gnarled and wise, stand sentinel amidst a flourish of tropical flora, a vibrant defiance against the azure expanse.

## History and Discovery

This remote sanctuary, veiled in the mists of time, remained uncharted until the year of our Lord eighteenhundred and forty-two, when the sagacious Captain Harris, aboard the whaler " amistad," first sighted its lonely shores.  Named in honour of  William Henry Howland, a gentleman of distinction and benefactor to the whaling trade, the isle thus earned its moniker.  Though briefly claimed by sundry nations in epochs past, Howland Island ultimately stands as a testament to  international agreement, declared a bird sanctuary under perpetual trusteeship, a haven shielded from man's avarice.

## Fauna and Flora

A bastion of biodiversity in the heart of the Pacific, Howland Isle teems with life albeit in measured abundance.  Seabirds, a feathered multitude, grace its skies;  frigatebirds with wings like ebony sails, red-footed boobies, and magnificent albatrosses nesting in colonies numbering in the thousands.  Land mammals are absent, save for the occasional vagrant rat, a somber reminder of man's intrusive reach. Yet, the island's flora prospers - coconut palms sway, hibiscus blooms riot in colour, and endemic plant species, evolved in solitude,  paint a picture of  nature's quiet resilience.

## Present State and Stewardship

Howland Island, a jewel entrusted to the care of mankind, remains largely untouched, a pristine echo of primordial epochs. Governed by a pact amongst nations, its purpose is singular:  preservation. No permanent human habitation graces its shores, save for intermittent scientific expeditions and vigilant guardians who ensure the sanctity of this avian paradise.  Thus, it stands as a beacon, a model of how humanity can, in stewardship,  honor the wild wonders bequeathed to us.
