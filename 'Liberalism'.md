# Liberalism

*An Ode unto Liberty's Flame*
_A creed most noble, shining bright, doth Liberalism proclaim,
Where Reason's torch doth light the way, and freedom's chorus doth acclaim.
It champions the individual, with rights enshrined and ever bold,
A bulwark 'gainst oppression's might, a tale of ages yet untold._

## Definition & Core Tenets

Liberalism, a philosophy sprung from the fertile fields of Enlightenment, posits  man's innate worth and dignity as its cornerstone. It venerates Reason as the guiding star, advocating for  individual liberty, circumscribed only by the freedoms of others. This creed doth champion limited governance, wherein the Sovereign's power is tempered by law and the consent of the governed.  Central tenets include:

* **Individual Autonomy:** Each soul, a vessel of inherent value, deserves autonomy in shaping their destiny, free from undue Estatal interference.
* **Rule of Law:**  Justice dispensed equally, not by whim, but through codified laws binding all,  high and low alike.
* **Free Markets:**  Commerce, flourishing like a garden untamed, guided by voluntary exchange, fosters prosperity for the multitude.
* **Separation of Powers:**  To prevent tyranny's insidious creep, governmental authority is divided, each branch a counterbalance to the others.

## Historical Evolution

From the quill of thinkers such as Locke and Montesquieu, Liberalism took root, blossoming amidst revolutions that shook the foundations of ancien régime.  The American and French Revolutions, beacons of this ideology, etched its principles onto the very fabric of nascent nations. Over time, Liberalism hath evolved, embracing  social reform, championing equality before the law, and advocating for  welfare provisions to safeguard the vulnerable within the framework of individual liberty.

##  A Paladin's Perspective

As a Paladin sworn to justice and compassion, I perceive Liberalism as a shield protecting the sanctity of the human spirit. It stands against the encroachments of absolutism, fostering an environment where  talents may flourish, and  each, irrespective of birth or creed,  can strive for betterment.  While  perfection remains a distant horizon, Liberalism's pursuit of reason, fairness, and individual empowerment aligns with the very tenets of a righteous life, making it a noble ideal worthy of our constant vigilance and support.
