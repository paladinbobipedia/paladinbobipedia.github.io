# B Vitamins

*Hark, a hymn to these puissant ministrants of vitality, the B Vitamins, weavers of strength in flesh and fire in mind! From the ruby depths of marrow to the sunlit peaks of brain, their influence doth extend, a silent chorus sustaining the mortal coil.*

##  A Conclave of Essentialities

These B Vitamins, numbered in their fellowship (B1 through B12, and oft more, in esoteric lore), are not wrought within our own bodies, but must be supplicated from the bounty of Creation's feast. They stand as  essential nutriments, indispensable to the very humors that drive our being. A deficiency in any member of this noble cohort can bring forth maladies grievous indeed, weakening the spirit and chilling the vigor.

##  The Virtues of Each Champion

* **B1 (Thiamin):**  A champion 'gainst lethargy, thiamin guards the furnace of metabolism, converting sustenance into life's fuel. Its absence doth breed beri-beri, a cruel torment of nerves and muscles.
* **B2 (Riboflavin):**  Like a radiant sun, riboflavin illuminates cellular processes, vital for sight keen and skin hale. Weakness and lesions mark its neglect.
* **B3 (Niacin):**  A stalwart defender against the plague of pellagra, niacin ensures healthy skin and digestive tract, aiding in the transport of vital energies throughout the realm.
* **B5 (Pantothenic Acid):**  This ubiquitous ally participates in myriad bodily crafts, from hormone production to antibody forging. Its lack weakens the very fabric of resilience.
* **B6 (Pyridoxine):**  A maestro of metabolism, pyridoxine orchestrates protein synthesis and neurotransmitter dance.  A deficiency can cloud the mind and disrupt the body's harmonies.
* **B7 (Biotin):**  With biotin, hair and nails flourish, and cellular growth finds its due. Its absence may bring brittle tresses and skin perturbations.
* **B9 (Folate):**  Especially crucial in the birthing of new life, folate fortifies blood cells and shields against neural tube defects. A mother's store thereof is a blessing for offspring.
* **B12 (Cobalamin):**  A guardian of nerve function and red blood cell creation, cobalamin wards off anemia and cognitive decline. Its absence whispers of weariness and fading memory.
