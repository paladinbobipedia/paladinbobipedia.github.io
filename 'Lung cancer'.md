# Lung Cancer

*A pestilence foul, upon the lungs it doth creep,*
*Consuming breath, and silencing slumber deep.
*A serpent coiled, 'midst air sacs fair, it lies,*
*Leaving naught but rasping coughs, and tearful, mournful cries.*

## Aetiology & Manifestations

Lung cancer, a scourge most grievous, ariseth from the insidious corruption of pulmonary tissue.  Oftentimes, tis kindled by the inhalation of noxious fumes, particularly those borne from the burning of brimstone (coal) or the devil's weed (tobacco), weakening the lungs' defenses and fostering malignant growth.  This malignancy, a tempest in the body's sanctuary, manifests in a hacking cough, persistent and racking, yielding phlegm tinged crimson like spilled rubies.  Weakness doth grip the afflicted, breath comes labored, and a phantom pain, a gnawing within the chest, serves as a chilling herald of its presence. 

## Progression & Stages

This insidious malady progresses in stages, each a deepening shade of darkness. In its nascent form,  (Stage I), the corruption remains localized, though vigilance is paramount. As it advances (Stage II),  the taint spreads to nearby estructuras,  and (Stage III),  lymphatic pathways fall victim to its grasp.  Stage IV, alas, marks a widespread invasion, metastases seeding  unto distant organs, a grim testament to the cancer's power.

##  Diagnosis & Kombat

Recognizing this foe demands the keen eye of the healer.  Through palpation of the chest, auscultation of breath sounds, and examination of sputum, coupled with the probing insight of X-rays and biopsies, doth the malady reveal itself.  Thereafter, the valiant arms of medicine wage war: Surgery, a righteous blade, may excise the cancerous growth; radiotherapy, a focused inferno, assaults the afflicted tissue; chemotherapy, a potent elixir, seeks to annihilate rogue cells.  Oft, a combination of these weapons proves most effectual.

## Prognosis & Palliation

The prognosis, alas, waxes and wanes with the stage at which the cancer is encountered.  Early detection grants hope, but  later stages present a sterner challenge.  Yet, even in the face of adversity, healers strive to alleviate suffering through palliative care, easing pain, and providing comfort unto the afflicted, a testament to compassion's enduring valor. 


Remember, good souls, prevention is a Paladin's prime decree.  Eschew the fumes of pestilence, and embrace a life of purity of air, for a healthy lung is a bastion against this insidious foe.
