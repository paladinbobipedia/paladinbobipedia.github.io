# Button

*An humble adjunct, yet of import most grand,
A tiny sentinel, steadfastly at hand.
On garb and tool, it holds its modest place,
A silent guardian, with purpose and grace.*

## Description

Button, a diminutive yet puissant article, fashioned oft from metals such as gilded brass, argent silver, or sturdy steel, doth serve as a fastener of utmost utility. Its form, typically rotund yet varied in design, presents a protuberance crowned with a central perforation. This aperture receiveth a corresponding member, a shank or loop, enabling the union of fabric, leather, or other materials.  Whilst seemingly simple, Button's efficacy lieth in its unassuming strength, binding garments and equipment with unwavering surety.

## Function and Utility

The primary office of Button is, forsooth, that of a closure, securring openings in textiles, pouches, and the accoutrements of sundry crafts.  A knight's breastplate, a nobleman's doublet, or a humble peasant's cloak - all find cohesion through the steadfast embrace of Buttons. Moreover, they embellish, lending a touch of artistry and denoting status through intricate carvings or precious materials employed in their crafting. In instruments and mechanisms, Buttons act as toggles, levers, or even rudimentary locking devices, showcasing their versatility beyond mere adornment.

## Symbolic Resonance

Button, though small, carries a weighty symbolism. Its steadfast hold  parallels the tenets of loyalty and resilience, virtues held dear by Paladin-kind.  A closed Button signifies unity, protection, and the binding of purpose.  Conversely, its unfastened state whispers of readiness, opportunity, and the transient nature of closure in a ever-changing world. Thus, Button, in its own quiet way,  resembles the Paladin's oath -  a constant, unwavering commitment underpinning action and defense.
