# Galeras

*A hymn unto Galeras, shining beacon 'gainst the encroaching night,
Thy forged resolve, a bastion strong, where virtue finds its guiding light.
From shadowed realms, thou banish'st dread, a paladin's unyielding might,
Galeras, name that echoes forth, a shield 'gainst chaos, ever bright.*
