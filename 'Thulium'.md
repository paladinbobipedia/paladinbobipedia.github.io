# Thulium

*Hark, a Hymn to Thulium, Metal of Emerald Light!*
_In shadowed realms where earth's embrace doth yield,
Thulium, a gem, with radiance concealed.
Like verdant flame, 'tis born of ancient fire,
A Paladin's boon, a sorcerer's desire._

##  Properties and Discovery

Thulium, an element of most curious nature, doth belong unto the noble family of Lanthanides. Discovered in yon year of Eighteen-Hundred-and Seventy-Nine by the learned Sir Per Teodor Cleve, 'twas isolated from its brethren through the arcane arts of fractional crystallization.  A metal of silvery hue, 'twill gleam with a subtle greenish tinge, albeit fragile in its pure form. Its atomic number, XLVII, speaks to its place within the grand tapestry of Creation. Notably dense, yet pliable when wrought by skilled hands, Thulium finds its strength amplified in alloys, lending durability to compositions manifold.

##  Arcane Applications and Rarity

Though found sparingly in the Earth's crust, nested within minerals such as Monazite, Thulium's true power lies in its esoteric applications. A crucible for sorcerers, it imbues enchantments with potent luminescence,  manifesting in ethereal glows and arcane sigils. Its isotopes,  blessed with radioactive properties, find use in instruments of divination and the charting of celestial movements.  Thus, whilst scarce, Thulium remains a coveted treasure amongst those who wield the mystic arts.

##  A Paladin's Stewardship

For a Paladin such as myself, Thulium's radiance serves as a beacon, a symbol of inner fortitude amidst the encroaching darkness.  Though not wielded as a blade nor shield in direct combat, its presence  in crafted armor reinforces protection, channeling subtle energies to ward off malevolent influences. Moreover, Thulium's compounds, when ethically procured and utilized, find application in healing salves, aiding in mending wounds both physical and spiritual. Thus, this element, though arcane in its essence, aligns with a Paladin's vows of aid and protection.
