# Scandium

*A hymn unto Scandium, metal of silver sheen,
In Earth's deep breast thou slumberest, a radiance unseen.
Though scarce and subtle, thy virtues brightly gleam,
In forge and flask, a steadfast champion's dream.*

##  Nomenclature and Discovery

Scandium, a noble element christened thus in honour of Scandinavia, its birthplace of discovery, doth hold the atomic number twenty-one upon the grand Tableau of Elements. First unveiled unto mankind by the learned spectroscopist, Lars Fredrik Nilson, in the year eighteenhundred and thirty-nine, this metallic marvel remained veiled in Earth's bosom until subsequently isolated in its pure form by  Baron Rosenheim, a seeker of arcane secrets, in eighteenhundred and sixty-nine. 

## Physical Properties, A Paladin's Appraisal

Scandium, in visage, doth resemble argent, yet possesses a subtle luminescence all its own.  A metal of admirable lightness, surpassing even aluminium in tensile fortitude, 'tis a champion amongst its kin. Resistant to corrosion, it withstands the ravages of time and unkind elements with stoic grace, a trait worthy of any paladin's armour. Its melting point, a sturdy eighteen hundred degrees Celsius, speaks to its inner resilience, akin to a warrior's unyielding spirit.

##  Chemical Conquests and Applications

Though reactive 'tis not in its pristine state, Scandium readily forms compounds, binding with other elements in alliances of scientific import. Its ionic form, Scandium(III), finds utility in  catalysts, accelerating reactions with the swiftness of a divinely guided strike. In alloys, especially those with aluminium and magnesium, scandium enhances strength and lightness, a boon for crafting weaponry both durable and nimble. Furthermore,  its luminescence, when activated by excitation, finds application in illuminating devices, akin to a beacon guiding the righteous path. 


## A Noble Element's Legacy

Scandium, though scarce upon this terrestrial sphere, stands as a testament to the hidden wonders within our world. Its properties, a medley of strength, resilience, and subtle brilliance, echo the virtues of a Paladin - courageous, helpful, and ever-shining in its own unique light. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the elemental realm, Scandium shall forever remain a symbol of  discovery and the enduring power latent in the seemingly commonplace.
