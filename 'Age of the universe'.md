# Age of the Universe

*An Ode unto Time's Grand Loom:*  From Void's embrace, Time's tapestry unfurled, stars like jewels on heavens dark and curled. Ages dance, a cosmic ballet spun, whilst mortals blink 'neath epochs yet begun. This, the Universe's span, we seek to ken, a measure writ in starlight's ancient pen.

##  Divinations of Duration

Thechnung of the Universe's nativity, a matter oft debated by sage and seer, remaineth veiled in mists of cosmic yore. Though mortal ken grasps but fragments dim, hallowed scriptures and celestial lore whisper of an epoch vast and prime.  Ancient tomes,  borne on winds of ages past,  proclaim a birth some **Thirteen Billion Cycles** hence, a dawn of light from primordial dense. This reckoning, grounded in echoes of Creation's hymn, stands as the most venerated estimation amongst scholars of the heavens.

## Markers of the Measured Time

1. **The Cosmic Microwave Background:** A faint afterglow, like embers 'pon the void,  leftover from the fiery Genesis deployed. Its study, a celestial fingerprint so fine,  suggests an infancy some **380,000 Years** since the Universe first did shine.
2. **Stellar Cemeteries:** Ancient star clusters, their lifecycles long since spent,  yield clues to epochs past, on time's vast rent. By analyzing their composition and decay, astronomers extrapolate a timeline's sway.
3. **The Expanding Cosmos:**  Like a blown bubble's gradual creep, the Universe doth ever outward leap. This recession, measured in redshift's gentle strain,  allows us to trace epochs,  unveiling Time's domain.  Through such observations, the vastness  unfurls,  a Universe **continuously evolving**,  eternally swirling.

## A Paladin's Perspective

Whilst mortal minds grapple with numbers so grand, remember, noble seeker,  Time's essence doth transcend. This Age, a testament to Creation's might,  a canvas on which Divinity paints its light. As a Paladin, I stand witness to its flow,  guarding  order through epochs,  ever steadfast and slow. May our valor echo through these boundless years,  a beacon of hope 'gainst the Universe's ancient fears.
