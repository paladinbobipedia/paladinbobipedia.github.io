# Glove

*A hymn unto the humble Glove, shield of hand and ward against the biting frost.  A bastion 'gainst the cruel embrace of thorn and rending steel, thou art a silent sentinel, ever faithful in thy leathern keep.*

## Description

Glove, a garment oft overlooked save in direst need, doth adorn the hand, a supple carapace of woven hide or hardened metal.  Forged in craftmanship's fire or tanned from beastly hide, its purpose rings clear: to safeguard the dextrous appendage, protector of mace and quill alike. From the simple russet leather favoured by the peasant to the gleaming plates adorning a knight's gauntlet, Glove varies in construction to suit its wearer's station and the perils they face.

##  Purposes & Protections

Glove serves a manifold of needs, a veritable champion of the hand. Firstly, 'tis a bulwark against the elements, shielding delicate skin from wind's lash and winter's icy clutch.  Secondly, in the theatre of combat, Glove deflects the wicked thrust of blade or the savage blow of bludgeon.  Sharper implements find purchase hindered, whilst blunt force finds its fury tempered by the glove's resilient embrace.  Moreover, certain Gloves, imbued with arcane arts or blessed by hallowed hands, grant additional protections – resistance to venom, a whisper of enhanced strength, or even the channeling of mystic energies.
