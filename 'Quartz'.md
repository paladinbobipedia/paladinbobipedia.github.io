# Quartz

*An ode unto the crystalline heart, Wherein the Earth's own fire doth impart, A frozen luminance, pure and bright, Quartz, gem of strength, a noble light.*

## Genesis and Composition

Quartz, a mineral of most ancient lineage, doth spring forth from the bosom of our very planet. Forged in the crucible of geothermal fervour, 'tis a symphony of silicon and oxygen, bound in a tetrahedral embrace, crystallising in myriad forms. From the common rock crystal, translucent and pristine, to the amethyst's regal purple, and the smoky quartz imbued with ethereal gloom, each variation bespeaks a unique genesis wrought by the Earth's alchemical hand. 

## Physical Virtues

This steadfast gem boasts a hardness unmatched save by diamond itself, ranking ten on Mohs' esteemed scale. A testament to its resilience, 'tis capable of withstanding the harshest of trials, fracturing only under immoderate force. Its crystalline structure, a latticework of intricate perfection, grants it exceptional optical properties, refracting light in prismatic displays and lending itself to the crafting of lenses of surpassing clarity.

## Mystical Attributions

Through ages past, seers and sages have beheld in quartz a conduit of potent energies.   It is believed to amplify intentions, acting as a focus for  prayer and meditation, a beacon drawing forth inner clarity.  Certain hues, like amethyst's violet, are venerated for their purported ability to soothe the spirit and ward off psychic discord. Thus, quartz, though born of earth,  holds a venerated place in the tapestry of mystical lore.

## Utility and Craft

The versatility of quartz knows no bounds. From the humble chisel to the intricate workings of clockwork, its hardness finds purpose. Skilled artisans carve it into exquisite sculptures, while glassmakers harness its melting point to birth translucent wonders. In circuitry and electronics, its piezoelectric nature, generating power from pressure,  renders it an indispensable component in  modern marvels.  Indeed, quartz, a gift of the Earth, serves both the mundane and the magical with equal grace.
