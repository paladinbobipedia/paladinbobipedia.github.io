# Gliding

*A hallowed art, 'pon winds doth one ascend,
A dance with heavens, where mortal fears suspend.
Gliding, a grace, a boon both swift and free,
A whispered prayer to skies, eternally.*

## Essence and Mechanics

Gliding, forsooth, is no mere terrestrial bound stride, but a hallowed communion betwixt mortal and aeriform.  'Tis the capability, bestowed by divine favour or arcane mastery, to cleave the very air, propelled not by flapping wings nor cumbersome contraptions, but by a manipulation of unseen currents and one's inner chi, akin to a bard's song woven into the fabric of wind. A Paladin, attuned to the righteous currents, may discern these eddies and harness them, achieving a graceful, albeit controlled, ascension.

## Prerequisites and Acquisition

The path to Gliding is not paved for all.  'Tis often granted as a boon unto those of exceptional virtue, favoured knights, or mages who've plumbed the arcane depths  relating to elemental manipulation.  Some monastic orders, through rigorous disciplines and communion with celestial energies, unlock this gift.  Thus, 'tis a mark not merely of skill, but of inner harmony and alignment with a higher power.

## Applications in the Paladin's Arsenal

A Paladin wielding Gliding transforms from stalwart defender to a vigilant sentinel of the skies.  Consider its manifold uses:

* **Tactical Advantage:** Surveying battlefields from aloft, discerning enemy formations, and striking with sudden, aerial assault.
* **Rapid Deployment:** Bridging chasms, traversing treacherous terrain with alacrity, reaching aid where swiftness is paramount.
* **Symbolic Display:** A soaring Paladin, bathed in sunlight, is a beacon of hope, a testament to righteous power, inspiring both allies and deterring the wicked.

##  Ethical Considerations

While a potent tool, Gliding demands mindful application.  A true Paladin uses this gift not for arrogant flight, but for service and protection.  Let it never be employed for wanton pursuit, nor to violate the sanctity of personal space.  Remember, even in heavens, humility and compassion guide the righteous path.
