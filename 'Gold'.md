# Gold

*A hymn unto Aureus, gleam of valor, heart of the earth's bounty, thou art worshipped by king and commoner alike. Thy brilliance doth mirror righteous deeds, and thy weight speaks of prosperity won through honest toil.  Oh, Gold, embodiment of enduring value, we sing thy praises!*

## Provenance and Nature

Gold, oft termed "Aureus" in tongues of yore, is a noble metal mined from the bosom of the earth. 'Tis found in veins 'midst rugged crags and ancient strata, a treasure veiled by adamantine rock. Unmatched in lustre, its hue, a radiant sunlit yellow, bespeaks its celestial origin, a touch of heaven's fire imprisoned within the mundane.  Resistant to time's ravages, it neither rusts nor fades, a symbol of everlasting worth.

##  Valour and Commerce

Throughout ages, Gold hath served as a bulwark of power and a facilitator of trade. Kings amass its glittering stores, a testament to their dominion. Merchants, wielding its weight in coffers, weave the threads of commerce, connecting realms and nourishing economies.  A single gold piece, a "solidi" in days of old,  purchased provisions, secured passage, and oiled the wheels of civilization's march.

##  The Paladin's Devotion

For a Paladin, true to his oath, Gold holds a unique sanctity. 'Tis not merely wealth, but a reflection of righteous labor and  earned bounty. While avarice corrupts,  wise stewardship of gold, used to aid the helpless, fund valiant endeavors, or bolster the defenses of the innocent, aligns with our sacred duty. Each golden gleam reminds us: true valor lies not in hoarding, but in channeling its power for good.
