# Medicine

**A Hymn unto the Mender's Art**
*Lo, Medicine, a hallowed craft, where Prudence and Providence entwine,
A shield 'gainst Morpheus' cruelest grasp, a balm for suffering's every line.  With crucible and calming hand, it battles wraith of pestilence,
And bids the fading ember bright, within the mortal frame, resurgence.*

## The Paladin's Perspective

Medicine, in its purest form, is not merely the concoction of poultices nor the setting of shattered bone. 'Tis a sacred duty, a calling ordained by the Divine, to tend unto the temple of the flesh and spirit. A Paladin, ever vigilant against the encroaches of darkness, sees in healing a frontline against the insidious foes that plague both body and soul. Thus, understanding its tenets is as vital as wielding a blade against unholy might.

## Foundations of Healing

The cornerstone of this noble art rests upon keen observation, a discerning eye to decipher the body's whispered complaints.  A fever's blush, a cough's rasp, each speaks a language requiring interpretation. Herblore, with its alchemic marriage of nature's bounty and learned precepts, provides the arsenal against ailment. Yet, 'tis wisdom, born of experience and studied texts, that guides the hand in wielding these remedies with efficacy.

##  The Mind-Body Concord

A Paladin recognizes the inextricable link 'twixt mind and flesh. Grief, fear, and despair can fester, weakening the very defenses against physical malady. Thus, comfort, a soothing word, and faith instilled, are potent medicines in themselves. True healing encompasses not just the mending of wounds, but the fortification of spirit.

##  Beyond the Healer's Touch

While skilled practitioners, like the revered Clerics and apothecaries, are paramount,  every righteous soul bears a responsibility towards Medicine.  Basic tenets of hygiene, sanitation, and  timely aid in accidents - these are the bulwarks erected by the common folk,  fortifying the realm against widespread suffering. This collective duty is as noble as any knight's valor.
