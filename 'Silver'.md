# Silver

*A hymn unto Argent, gleaming light of heavens' hold,
Whose touch doth banish shadow, valor's tale unfold.
In moonbeam's mimicry, thou shimmers, pure and bright,
A paladin's truest friend, a beacon in the night.*

## Provenance and Properties

Silver, a most noble metal, draweth its genesis from the very bowels of the earth, wrought in fiery chasms and yielded forth by patient toil. Of pallid hue, 'tis akin to moonlight captured, and possesses a lustre unmatched save by the sun's own gold.  Resistant to time's corroding caress, it endureth, a steadfast sentinel against decay. Moreover, Silver boasts a singular potency 'gainst foul creatures of shadow and blight, its very essence a bane unto unholy beings. 

##  Artisan's Alloy and Applications

The cunning artisan, wielding hammer and forge, doth fashion Silver into myriad forms. Exquisite tableware, it graceth noble feasts; in weaponry, blades imbued with its essence cleave with ethereal swiftness, serving as bulwarks 'gainst the wicked.  Artisans also craft filigree and adornments, weaving tales of elegance and protection, for Silver's gleam is as oft a symbol of warding as of beauty.   Within alchemical circles, its properties are pondered, for some whisper of potent mixtures born from its union with other elements, capable of healing and arcane might.

##  Symbolism and Sacramental Grace

Beyond its material virtues, Silver holds a hallowed place in the hearts of the devout.  A mirror to the moon, oft associated with lunar deities and feminine virtues, it symbolizes purity, truth, and the waxing and waning of life's cycles. In many a sacred rite, Silver chalices and vessels are employed, channeling blessings and serving as conduits of divine grace.  Paladins, guardians of righteousness, venerate Silver-etched armor and holy symbols, for its presence is believed to bolster courage and repel the encroaching darkness. Thus, Silver stands not merely as a metal, but a beacon of faith and valor.
