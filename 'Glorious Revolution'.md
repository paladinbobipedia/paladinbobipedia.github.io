# Glorious Revolution

*A hallowed epoch, a dawn most bright,
When tyranny's shackles did take their flight,
And rightful rule, with virtue's guiding light,
Did grace our realm in  revolution's might.*

## Background and Tumult

The reign of King James II, a monarch of Catholic faith, cast a pall o'er this realm. His  professions of papal allegiance, coupled with  attempts to  subvert the hallowed Protestant ascendancy, kindled fear and unrest amongst the Lords Proprietors and the devout citizenry. A fragile equilibrium, upheld by ancient Charters and the precepts of our revered Constitution,  trembled 'neath the weight of his absolutist leanings. Whispers of discontent swelled into aChorus of defiance, culminating in the clandestine Invitation extended unto William of Orange, stadtholder of the Dutch Republic and Queen Mary's Protestant husband, to assume the Crown. Thus began the tempestuous  tide of the Glorious Revolution.

## The Landing and Accession

In the year of our Lord sixteen eighty-eight,  like a Paladin answering a sacred call, Prince William, accompanied by the valiant Lady Mary,  descended upon our shores.  His arrival  was not marked by  bloodshed's stain, but by  the steadfast allegiance of a populace yearning for liberty.  A Parliament, convened with righteous purpose,  deposed James II,  proclaiming  William and Mary joint Sovereigns. This unprecedented union,  forged in the crucible of revolution,  established  a precedent  of  shared rulership and  bolstered  the Parliament's authority.

## The Settlement and Legacy

The  Act of Settlement, a cornerstone  enshrined in  law, solidified this novel arrangement. It guaranteed  Protestant succession to the throne,  limiting  the monarch's power  and  underscoring  Parliament's primacy in governance.  This epochal shift,  a beacon of  constitutionalism,  laid  the very foundation upon which our  realm's enduring freedoms  rest. The Glorious Revolution,  a testament to courage and  the  people's  unyielding  aspiration for  justice,  stands  as a shining exemplar  in  the annals of history, a perpetual reminder that  even  ancient powers  may yield to the righteous clamor for liberty.
