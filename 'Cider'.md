# Cider

*An Ode unto the Golden Nectar*
_In goblet held, a sunlit gleam it doth impart,
A harvest's kiss, a warrior's warming heart.
From orchard boughs, where verdant apples sleep,
Cider awakes, a solace, secrets deep._

## Provenance and Production

Cider, a libation of noble lineage, hails from the ancient art of fermenting pressed apples, bounty of the earth's fruitful trees.  This venerable process, oft wrought by skilled artisans termed 'cideriers', commenceth with the gathering of ripe, succulent apples, their varieties lending diverse nuances to the final draught. Crushing these fruits releases their sugary essence, which, 'pon admixture with wild yeasts or cultivated strains, giveth birth to a merry metamorphosis. Fermentation, a mystical dance of sugars and microbes, transmuteth this juice into cider, a beverage both invigorating and subtly effervescent.  

## Varieties and Flavors

As diverse as the apple orchards themselves, cider presents a palate's tapestry of flavors. From the crisp, bone-dry iterations, tart as a winter's morn, to the lusciously sweet, akin to summer sun-drenched days, a spectrum doth exist. Some ciders, aged in oak's embrace, acquire hints of spice and toasted nuts, whispering tales of time's gentle craft. The inclusion of fruits like berries or pears adds further layers, crafting symphonies for the discerning tongue.

##  A Paladin's Perspective

Cider, whilst a balm for the weary soul,  is no mere tavern tipple. 'Tis a drink befitting valor and respite alike. After a righteous campaign, its gentle effervescence doth refresh the spirit, and its fruity notes uplift the heart.  Shared amongst comrades, it fosters camaraderie, binding bonds of brotherhood forged in the fires of chivalry. Moreover,  cider's origins in the earth's bounty remindth us  of the cyclical nature of life,  mirroring the Paladin's own dedication to protect and nurture the world's verdant beauty.   Thus, raise a goblet high, for cider is a toast to valor, harvest, and the enduring strength found in simple pleasures. 
 
## Consumption and Celebration

Cider, best enjoyed chilled, finds its place in both humble hearth and grand feast.  Served in tankards or elegant goblets, it accompanies roasted meats, hearty cheeses, and spiced pastries with admirable grace. Festivals and gatherings, be they of joyous harvest or solemn remembrance,  swell with the convivial atmosphere cider doth inspire. A sip shared is a story exchanged, a link in the chain of communal spirit. In its golden hue, we glimpse the warmth of kinship, a fitting libation for knights and common folk alike.
