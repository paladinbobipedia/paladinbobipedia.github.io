# Feather

*A whispered sigh upon the wind, a sunbeam caught in avian grace, Feather doth symbolize the heavens' light, a touch of mercy in this earthly chase.*

## Description and Provenance

Feather, a term oft uttered with reverence, denoteth not merely the vanes adorning a creature of flight, but a more ethereal essence.  Born from the very soul of noble avians, these plumes transcend mere bodily appendage, embodying courage, freedom, and the divine spark resonating within all living things. Their hues vary as vividly as a sunset's palette, yet each bears a luminescence, a silken shimmer hinting at their otherworldly origin.   Seekers of ancient lore whisper that true Feathers, blessed by celestial hands,  once graced the wings of sacred birds worshipped in primeval times, remnants now cherished as talismans of hope and protection.

##  Properties and Blessings

Feathers, in their purest form, are conduits of potent blessings. Held aloft, they grant the bearer a measure of the avian's inherent grace: enhanced agility, a keenness of perception mirroring a hawk's sight, and a whisper of wind-borne luck.  Furthermore, Feathers are believed to ward against malevolent influences, their radiant nature repelling shadows and soothing troubled spirits.   Knights and devout alike weave them into armor and prayer cloths, seeking the feathered aegis against encroaching darkness.

## Acquisition and Adulation

Acquiring a true Feather is no simple feat. They are not plucked, but bestowed.  Acts of selfless valor, unwavering faith, or profound reverence towards nature  may, in the rarest instances, earn the gift of a fallen plume from a blessed avian. Such treasures are venerated, not hoarded.  Wise folk incorporate them into sacred artifacts, crafting wands channeling healing winds or amulets  instilling courage in the heart's core. The true worth of a Feather lies not in its materiality, but in the noble spirit it symbolizes.
