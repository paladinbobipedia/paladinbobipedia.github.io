# Alcohol

*A libation most potent, a draught both bane and boon,
From fertile grain it springs, 'neath sun and silver moon.
It warms the weary soul, yet tempts with siren's call,
Granting mirth, or madness, heed its sway, lest thou shall fall.*

##  Nature and Procurement

Alcohol, oft termed "strong water" or "liquid fire," is a concoction wrought by the alchemical hand of fermentation. Humble grains, yeasts' subtle magic entwined, yield sugars transformed into ethanol, a spirit that dances on the tongue. Barley, rye, grapes, and fruits, all lend themselves to this ancient process, birthing brews diverse in flavour and potency. From the mead-hall's honeyed draught to the vintner's ruby wine,  alcohol's genesis lies in the bounty of the earth, coaxed forth through patient craft.

## Properties and Effects

This elixír, whilst a source of merriment and social lubrication, doth wield a puissant influence upon the mortal frame. In measured partaking, it eases cares, quickens the pulse of gaiety, and loosens the tongue's bridle. Yet, excess unleashes a tempest within, blurring perception, inflaming passion, and dimming the light of reason.  Long indulgence fosters lethargy, weakens the body's bulwark, and invites the Siren Song of addiction, a treacherous path indeed.

##  Divinance and Decorum

Through epochs, alcohol has held a hallowed place in rituals and celebrations. In pagan rites, it invoked deities; amongst Christendom, it graced festive boards and solemn sacraments.  However, a Paladin, sworn to virtue and temperance, views its consumption with measured reverence. While modest enjoyment may find place,  excess must be shunned, lest it cloud the righteous mind and betray the sacred tenets of self-control.  Remember, true courage lies not only in wielding steel but in mastering one's own desires.
