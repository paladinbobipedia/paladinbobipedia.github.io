# Diabetes Mellitus

*A pox most foul, yet oft unseen, it doth ravage the very humours, leaving sweetness in wake of withered strength.  Diabetes mellitus, a serpent coiled 'round the body's furnace, stealing vitality and bringing forth a tempest of thirst unsated. Yet, withschild and understanding, we may combat its insidious grasp.*

##  Nature of the Affliction

Diabetes mellitus, a malady of grievous import, afflicts the body's intricate mechanism of sustenance.  'Tis a disorder wherein the noble fortress of pancreas, keeper of insulin, forgeth naught but feeble amounts, or its crafted elixir proves ineffective in unlocking the citadel of cells to receive life-giving sugars (glucose). This führtth to a superfluity of sweetness within the bloodstream, a veritable tide of honey unabsorbed, leaving the very tissues famished despite abundance.

##  Manifestations of the Scourge

Mark well the heraldry of this affliction: an unquenchable thirst, a constant craving as desert doth crave the oasis. Frequent urination, a body's plea to expel the excess sweetness, becomes a weary burden.  Weakness, akin to a dwindling hearth fire, saps the vigour. And oft, blurred vision doth cloud the sight, a consequence of the sugar's assault upon the ocular lenses.  Untreated, it may unleash further horrors: sores slow to heal, numbness in extremities, and a susceptibility to infections, a chilling vulnerability.

##  Path to Mitigation and Mastery

Though Diabetes mellitus poseth a challenge, 'tis not an unyielding foe. Through vigilant husbandry of diet, moderation in the consumption of sugars and starches becomes paramount. Regular exercise, a paladin's training, invigorates the body's furnace and aids insulin's function.  Oft, medicaments, akin to enchanted draughts, are prescribed to bolster insulin's power or mimic its action. Constant monitoring of blood sugar, a sacred vigil, guides treatment and ensures balance. With diligence and the aid of learned healers, this ailment can be tamed, allowing a life of vigour albeit tempered by mindful practices.
