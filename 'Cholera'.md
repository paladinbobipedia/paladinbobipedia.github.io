# Cholera

*An ill wind doth blow, from fetid mire it springs,*
*Cholera, scourge grim, on mortal coil it clings.
*A pestilence most foul, with pangs that rend and tear,
*Yet faith shall be our bulwark, 'gainst this unseen snare.*

## Definition & Aetiology

Cholera, a pestilence of dire import, afflicts mankind with a swift and merciless malady. Its genesis lieth in a venomous serpent, a microscopic fiend named Vibrio cholerae, oft harboring within brackish waters corrupted by filth. This insidious agent, ingurgitated through tainted victuals or drink, doth colonize the bowels, unleashing a torrent of watery flux exceeding all natural bounds. 

## Symptoms & Progression

Mark well, gentle reader, the heraldry of this plague:  violent, ceaseless vomiting and diarrhoea, resembling the purging of a tempestuous sea. Profuse sweating, cramps that bind like iron, and a thirst as parched as a desert's embrace accompany this torment. Should succour not arrive,  rapid dehydration ensues, leaving the afflicted pallid, weak, and teetering upon the precipice of oblivion. Death, a swift shadow, stalks those bereft of timely aid.

##  Treatment & Prevention

Though a fearsome foe, Cholera yields not entirely to our unwavering mettle. Rehydration, a paramount weapon, must be wielded with diligence, replenishing lost fluids with brackish solutions enriched with salts and sugars.  Ointments and concoctions derived from plant allies, whilst offering palliative comfort, cannot vanquish the root cause. Prevention, however, stands as our strongest shield: pure water, scrupulous sanitation, and the diligent cooking of sustenance shall stand as bulwarks against this pestilence.  

## Paladin's Duty

As a Paladin sworn to aid the afflicted, 'tis our sacred duty to shepherd the sick, administer solace, and propagate the tenets of hygiene. We shall be beacons of hope, guiding communities towards sanitation and vigilance.  May divine grace, coupled with our earthly efforts, curb this scourge and shield the innocent from Cholera's wrath.
