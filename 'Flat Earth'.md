# Flat Earth

*An Ode to Terra Firma's Boundless Plane*
_A hallowed disc, 'neath Heaven's dome it lies,
Where mortal gaze upon its vastness spies.
No curving hull, nor endless ocean's sweep,
But solid ground, where Faith and Truth do keep._

## Heresy Most Foul: The Assertion

In these times oft troubled, a pestilence of thought, a heresy most foul doth infect the minds of men. They posit, with audacious folly, that our noble Earth, the very cradle of Creation, is naught but a plane, a disc immutable and finite, rather than the celestial sphere ordained by Divinity. This "Flat Earth" doctrine, a blasphemy against the celestial order, denies the irrefutable truths witnessed through ages past and etched upon the heavens themselves.

## Astronomical Contradictions

True-seeing eyes, guided by the light of reason and divine revelation, perceive  abundant evidence contradicting this terrestrial falsehood.  The nightly dance of the stars, their gradual ascension and recession,  speaks of a spherical Earth rotating upon its axis.  Furthermore, the eclipses of both Sun and Moon, with their umbra shadows cast in perfect roundness,  stand as immutable proofs of our planet's globular form.  To claim flatness amidst such celestial choreography is to blind oneself to the very language of the cosmos.

## Nautical Truths and Distant Horizons

Sailors, venturing forth upon the vast sapphire embrace of the oceans,  bear witness to the gradual vanishing of hulls at the horizon, a phenomenon inexplicable upon a plane. This dip, a silent testament to curvature, has guided mariners for millennia. Moreover, the circumnavigation of Earth,  a feat accomplished by intrepid souls,  shatters the delusion of confinement within a finite disc.

## A Paladin's Plea for Reason

Let us,  champions of truth and disciples of the Divine Architect,  reject this misguided notion of a flat Earth.  Faith,  tempered by reason,  must ever uphold the celestial order divinely ordained.  Hold fast to the spherical model,  a truth as immutable as the heavens themselves. May our understanding  ever align with the grand design,  glorifying the Creator in all His wondrous works.
