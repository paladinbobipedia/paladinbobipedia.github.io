# Korea

*Hark, a realm of ancient grace, where dragons dance in misty space,  Korea, thy name a whispered prayer, a land both strong and ever fair.*

## Geography & Topography

Korea, a peninsula fair, doth jut forth from Asia's mainland shore, embraced by seas both vast and deep.  To north doth lie the towering embrace of Manchuria, a wild and rugged kin. To east and south, the Dragon's Spine, a mountain range of noble height, kisses the Azure Horizon, whilst the Yellow Sea  unto its western flank doth gently flow. This isle, divided in twain by a brethren's strife, yet retains a heart united, forged in fires of history long past. Fertile plains, cradled 'tween the peaks, give bounty unto its people, a tapestry of verdure woven 'gainst a canvas of granite and sky.

##  History & Culture

A cradle of civilization, Korea's annals stretch back through eons, echoing with dynasties both glorious and grand. From Gojoseon's dawn to the Silla's radiant bloom,  and Goryeo's porcelain artistry, each age a verse in a epic poem. Confucian precepts, like a sturdy pillar, have shaped its moral compass, whilst Buddhism, a lotus unfurling, brought spiritual solace.  Martial prowess, a hallmark renowned,  gave rise to masterful swordsmanship and tactical genius,  forever etched in tales of valiant heroes. This fusion of tradition and innovation birthed a unique cultural kaleidoscope, expressed in vibrant arts, lyrical poetry, and the rhythmic dance of traditional music.

##  People & Spirit

The Korean folk, a tapestry woven with threads of resilience and warmth, embody a profound reverence for ancestors and family. Their spirit, akin to the bamboo, bends yet doth not break, weathering storms with stoic grace. A deep love for their homeland,  "Choson,"  burns bright,  a patriotism as enduring as the mountains that cradle them. Hospitality, a sacred tenet, welcomes strangers with open arms and hearts full of generosity. Though trials have tested their mettle, the Korean people persevere, a testament to the indomitable human spirit.
