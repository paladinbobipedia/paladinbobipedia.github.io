# Connecticut

*Hark, a hymn to fair Connecticut, where verdant hills doth meet the sapphire sea,
A realm of sturdy folk, with hearts so free,
And spirits forged in valor, loyalty. *

In  year 1636, under the aegis of devout founders, a commonwealth was established, enshrining principles of self-governance and religious freedom.
