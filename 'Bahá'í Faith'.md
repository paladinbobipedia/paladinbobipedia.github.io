# Bahá'í Faith

*Hark! A radiant star doth shine amidst the tempestuous night,  
The Bahá'í Faith, a beacon bright, proclaiming unity's light. 
'Tis a summons to oneness, a harmony most rare,
Where mortal souls, in God's embrace, transcend all earthly care.*

## Origins and Prophetic Lineage

This esteemed Dispensation, sprung forth in the verdant lands of Persia, traceth its genesis unto the pronouncements of the Báb, a Manifestation of God in the 19th century.  He foretold the advent of Baháʼu'lláh, hailed as the promised one, whose elucidations laid the very foundation of this Faith. Baháʼu'lláh, a Prince of divine decree, penned scriptures of surpassing wisdom, revealing a path to global concord and the progressive emancipation of humankind. His teachings, a glorious continuation of  prophetic lines from Abraham to Krishna, Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus,  affirm a unified Godhead manifesting through successive Messengers.

## Core Tenets and Principles

The Bahá'í Faith, a tapestry woven with threads of profound conviction,  rests upon tenets most noble:

* **Oneness of God:**  A single, all-encompassing Divinity, transcending  limitations of name and form, is worshipped with utmost reverence.
* **Unity of Humankind:** All souls, irrespective of race, creed, or origin, are  equal children of God, destined for  harmonious co-existence.
* **Progressive Revelation:** God's  revelations unfold through successive Messengers, each clarifying and enriching the previous, culminating in Baháʼu'lláh's definitive Word.
* **Independent Investigation of Truth:**  Seekers are encouraged to  scrutinize scriptures and teachings with open minds and hearts, arriving at understanding through personal  reflection.
* **Elimination of Prejudice:**  All forms of bigotry, whether based on religion, ethnicity, or gender, are to be eradicated, replaced by love and understanding.
* **Justice and Equity:**  A fair and impartial system  governing society, safeguarding the rights and welfare of all, is paramount.
* **Universal Education:**  Knowledge is a sacred trust,  accessible to all,  empowering individuals and fostering societal progress.

Emphasis is placed on  acts of service,  ethical conduct, and  building a more just world – a  manifestation of worship in daily life.
