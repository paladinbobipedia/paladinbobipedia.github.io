# Noah's Ark

*A vessel of faith, 'pon waters vast it did embark,
Preserving life's flame, from tempest's cruel dark.
Noah, God's chosen, with righteous heart afire,
Built a sanctuary, 'gainst wrath and Nature's ire.*

## The Divine Mandate

In days of yore, when wickedness did stain the Earth's fair face,  the Almighty, in His infinite mercy yet stern judgment, beheld mankind's corruption. Upon Noah, a man of unblemished faith, descended a weighty decree. He bade Noah construct an ark, a colossal vessel of gopher wood, to shelter himself, his kin, and twain of every creature, from a deluge meant to cleanse the world of its iniquity. This divine mandate, a testament to God's grace and power, served as the genesis of the Ark's hallowed purpose.

## Construction and Dimensions

Guided by the Lord's explicit instructions, Noah, with unwavering zeal and aided by his sons, toiled for years upon this monumental undertaking. The ark, a leviathan of timber, measured three hundred cubits in length, fifty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height – proportions exceeding mortal ken save by divine revelation. Within its capacious hold, compartments were meticulously crafted, provisioned with food stores and nesting places for the myriad creatures entrusted to its care.  A towering roof, sealed with pitch, ensured impermeability against the impending deluge. This architectural marvel stood as a symbol of obedience and human endeavor in the face of the Divine.

## The Gathering of Beasts

As foretold, pairs of every winged fowl and beast, tame and wild, flocked to the ark's entrance, drawn by an unseen directive. Noah, acting as God's shepherd, received them with reverence, guiding them into their designated quarters. This assembly, a microcosm of Creation itself, underscored the sanctity of all life in the eyes of the Creator, and foreshadowed the renewal that awaited upon the receding waters.

## The Deluge and Its Aftermath

When the appointed time arrived, Heaven's wrath unfurled. Torrents of rain, unending and catastrophic, submerged the world, drowning the wicked and leaving only the ark, a solitary beacon of hope, afloat upon the maelstrom. For forty days and forty nights, the deluge raged, a testament to God's power and judgment. Eventually, the waters receded, revealing a cleansed Earth, reborn and awaiting its inhabitants' return.  Noah, releasing a raven and then a dove, witnessed the withdrawal of the waters and the nascent promise of a verdant new beginning.  He, along with his family and the surviving creatures, disembarked, planting the seeds of a renewed covenant between God and humankind.


Noah's Ark, thus, stands not merely as a vessel of timber and faith, but as a potent symbol of divine mercy, second chances, and the enduring triumph of hope over despair. It echoes through the ages, a timeless testament to the power of obedience and the unwavering love of the Creator.
