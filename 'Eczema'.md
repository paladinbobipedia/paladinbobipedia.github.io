# Eczema

*A pox most grievous, yet oft borne with valor, upon the fair skin it doth etch its mournful mark, a torment unseen by many, yet felt keenly by those afflicted. We, Knights of healing, strive to soothe its fiery kiss and grant respite, for eczema's sting deserveth our empathy and learned hand.*

## Description & Manifestation

Eczema, a malady oft termed "the itch," presenteth itself as a scourge upon the epidermis, manifesting in patches of inflamed, parched, andweilen most irritatingly, pruriginous (itchy) skin. These afflicted areas, prone to blossom in the bends of elbows, behind knees, or upon the visage of babes, may swell, redden, and weep serous fluid, a testament to the body's troubled harmony.  Sometimes, akin to a winter's frostbite, they crack and flake, leaving the sufferer vulnerable to further vexation.

## Aetiology: The Root of Unrest

Though the precise genesis of this dermal distemper demeureth shrouded in some mystery, learned physicians posit sundry factors as contributors. Heredity, a fickle mistress, doth oft play a role, transmitting a predisposition  through familial lines.  Furthermore,  environmental aggressors such as irritants (soaps fierce, fabrics coarse) and allergens (pollen's dance, certain foodstuffs) can ignite the eczema's flame in susceptible souls.  A weakened immune system, too, may lend itself to this affliction's unwelcome tenancy.

## Palliation & Governance

Whilst a complete cure eludes us, valiant healers employ various strategems to assuage eczema's torment and bring solace.  Moisturizing balms, rich and soothing, stanch the dryness, forming a protective barrier. Topical unguents, containing corticosteroids of potent grace, quell the inflammation's fire.  For the most fervent outbreaks, oral medications, wielded with wisdom, may be prescribed to temper the immune system's overzealous response.  Moreover, identifying and shunning  personal allergens, akin to a knight avoiding a dragon's lair, proves crucial in managing this persistent foe.  

## A Paladin's Counsel

Remember, sufferers of eczema, ye are not alone in this battle. Approach healers with openness, heed their counsel, and nurture thy skin with care.  Patience, like a steadfast shield, is thy ally. Through disciplined regimen and the aid of learned practitioners,  the fiery grip of eczema may be loosened, granting thee respite and a restoration of comfort.  Forge onward, brave souls, for hope ever flickers in the face of adversity!
