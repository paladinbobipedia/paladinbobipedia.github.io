# Angle

*A hallowed ward 'gainst shadow's blight, an argent beacon in darkest night,
Angle stands, a steadfast might, shielding realms from endless fight.*

##  Definition and Lore

Angle, oft termed "the Protector's Gaze," doth denote a sacred warding inscribed upon artifacts, edifices, or even consecrated ground. Forged in the crucible of fervent prayer and blessed by righteous hands, it shimmereth with an ethereal luminescence, a silver sheen warding off taint and malice. Legend whispers Angle's genesis lies in the dawn of creation, a celestial script etched by the Creator Himself,  a lingering echo of divine protection bequeathed upon mortals.  

## Function and Manifestation

This holy sigil serves not as a mere passive barrier, but a dynamic shield.  Angle pulses with sanctified energy, repelling unholy influences, banishing fiendish incursions, and staunching the flow of corrupting energies.  Its manifestation varies: a radiant aura enveloping a stronghold, glyphs ablaze with inner light upon a paladin's armor, or a subtle silver shimmer safeguarding a sacred relic.  When challenged, Angle flares with intensified brilliance, momentarily blinding the unholy and dealing grievous harm to creatures of darkness.

## Crafting and Consecration

To imbue an object with Angle demands more than mortal craft. Master artisans, guided by devout clerics and sanctioned by orders of paladins, weave the sigil through rituals of intricate song and sacred geometry.  The very materials used must resonate with purity, often silver, mithril, or consecrated stone. The culminating act involves a paladin's fervent invocation, channeling divine power to etch the Angle permanently, binding it to the object's essence.

## Symbolism and Legacy

Angle stands as a potent symbol: of unwavering faith, righteous courage, and the enduring protection bestowed by the divine. Its presence inspires hope in the hearts of the faithful, a visible testament that even amidst encroaching darkness,  the light perseveres. Throughout ages, heroes have wielded Angle-imbued relics, safeguarding kingdoms and vanquishing evils, cementing its legacy as a cornerstone of  good's eternal struggle.
