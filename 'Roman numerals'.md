# Roman Numerals

*A hymn unto these ancient tokens, wrought in ages past, Wherein the strength of empires stood, their legacy shall last.  From I to M, they weave a tale, of quantify and might, A language etched in stone and scroll, a beacon burning bright.*

## Origins and Usage
Roman numerals, forsooth, hail from the venerable Roman realm, a testament to their prowess in governance and record-keeping. Employed by those noble folk for epochs, these symbols served to denote quantities, years, chapters, and in the annals of mighty deeds. Though supplanted by our decimal system in modern times, their archaic elegance endures, a relic of bygone grandeur.

## Construction and Notation
Each Roman numeral deriveth its value from a constellation of letters, each imbued with numerical significance:

* **I:**  One, as humble as the first sunrise.
* **V:** Five, a valiant hand outstretched.
* **X:** Ten, a balanced scale of justice.
* **L:** Fifty, a legion's stride in formation.
* **C:** One hundred, a Centurion's command.
* **D:** Five hundred, a Duke's dominion.
* **M:** One thousand, a monarch's vast realm.

These are combined, with precedence dictating their worth.  Numerals of lesser value placed before greater ones signify addition (e.g., VI = 6), whilst those after indicate subtraction (e.g., IV = 4).

##  Subtleties and Grandeur
Mark well, gentle reader,  the intricacies woven within:

* **Repetition:**  For multiples, letters are repeated (III = 3, XX = 20).
* **Limitless Extension:** Though M represents a thousand, by repetition (MMMM)  far greater magnitudes may be expressed.
* **The Barred Difference:** A horizontal bar over a numeral (e.g.,overline{IV}) denotes multiplication by one thousand. Thus, $\overline{IV}$ signifies 4,000.


Thus, Roman numerals, a legacy of valor and clarity, stand as a testament to the enduring power of symbolic expression.
