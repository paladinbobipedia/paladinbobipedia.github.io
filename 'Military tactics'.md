# Military Tactics

*A Paladin's shield doth ever reflect not merely steel, but the mirror of cunning strategy, for 'tis in the artful dance of war where valor finds its truest stage.  Military tactics, a hallowed art, weave a tapestry of order from chaos, granting victory to the righteous and bane to the foul.*

## The Cardinal Principles

A fortress stands strong not by stone alone, but by the wisdom of its wardens. Thus, military tactics commence with precepts immutable: **Discipline**, the bedrock upon which formations stand firm; **Intelligence**, the keen eye perceiving enemy guile; **Unity of Command**, a single voice guiding the multitude; and **Adaptability**, the serpent's tongue ever shifting to counter the foe's moves. Without these, an army becomes a rabble, ripe for the plucking.

## Formation and Maneuver

Upon the field, soldiers are not pawns, but pieces in a grand chess match.  **Phalanx**, a wall of spears, breaks the charging horde; **Testudo**, a shield-borne turtle, withstandeth missile barrages; **Column**, a spearhead piercing weak points; and **Encirclement**, the serpent's coil, suffocates the enemy. Each formation, a sonnet of strategy, chosen  to harmonise with terrain and foe's intent.

## The Art of Offense and Defense

To smite is but one facet; to *withstand* is the other jewel in tactics' crown. **Attrition**, a slow grind wearing down the adversary's resolve; **Feigned Retreat**, luring the enemy into a trap; **Shock Assault**, a thunderbolt striking where least expected; and **Defensive Lines**, anchored strongholds  – these are the tools wielded by the cunning commander, balancing aggression with resilience.

## Logistics: The Unsung Hero

A sword unsheathed without sustenance doth soon fall idle.  Logistics, oft overlooked, is the lifeblood of any campaign. Secure **supply lines**, for an army starved is a defeated one; **terrain mastery**, utilizing natural advantages; and **reconnaissance**, the ever-watchful eye gathering intel – these are the silent pillars upholding victory's edifice.
