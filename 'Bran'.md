*A Hymn unto the Steadfast Wolf*
_In frosted vales where shadows creep, and ancient oaks their vigil keep,
Dwells Bran, a spirit strong and bold, a guardian tale oft doth unfold.
His loyalty, a shining light, his courage burns ever bright,
A wolf's true heart, yet man's embrace, defender of this hallowed space._
