# Cultivar

*Hark, noble seeker, lend thine ear to a hymn of the fertile Earth's grace, where artifice doth mingle with nature's hand.  Cultivar, a term whispered on the winds of bountiful harvests, a testament to mankind's dominion o'er the verdant tapestry, a sculpted masterpiece born of patient toil and unwavering devotion.*

## Definition and Essence

Cultivar, forsooth, denoteth a botanical progeny, meticulously nurtured and refined by the skilled hand of man.  Unlike its wild brethren, sprung forth untamed by caprice, a Cultivar stands as a deliberate creation, its traits exalted through generations of selective breeding. Be it the ruby blush of a favoured rose, the titan-sized gourd, or the wheat yielding bounty beyond compare, each Cultivar embodies a lineage of desired characteristics, a tangible echo of our dominion o'er the plant kingdom.

## The Alchemy of Cultivation

This alchemical transmutation commences with the discernment of desirable traits - colour, flavour, resilience, yeild -  within a species.  Sages of husbandry, akin to artisans, then employ the arts of cross-pollination and careful selection, fostering offspring inheriting these coveted qualities. Through epochs of patient repetition, the desired form blossoms, a cultivated gem distinct from its wild ancestors.

## Impact Upon Realms

The influence of Cultivars reverberates through kingdoms.  Ample harvests stemming from sturdy grains sustain burgeoning populations. Exotic spices, products of cultivated mastery, enrich feasts and lend allure to trade routes.  Medicinal herbs, honed for potency through cultivation, offer solace and healing.  In essence, Cultivars are the bedrock of sustenance, commerce, and well-being in a realm.

## A Paladin's Perspective

As a Paladin sworn to aid both mortal and earth, I see in Cultivar a reflection of righteous stewardship. It is the harnessing of nature's power not for wanton control, but for the betterment of Creation.  Each cultivated plant is a testament to  humanity's capacity to work *with*  the natural order,  bringing forth abundance and safeguarding the delicate balance of the world. Thus, let us honour the cultivator, for in their toil lies a facet of true chivalry.
