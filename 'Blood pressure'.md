# Blood Pressure

*A Hymn unto the Crimson Surge*
_Within yon vessels, ever flowing, a potent force doth reside,
The lifeblood's press, a rhythmic tide, where health and vigour abide.
Blood pressure, named, a whispered plea,  to understand its decree,
For in its dance, both weak and strong, our mortal coils belong._

## Definition and Essence

Blood pressure, prithee, is the valiant strain exerted by the coursing ichor, the very lifeblood, against the elástica walls of our arteries.  'Tis a dual measure, expressed in twin numbers: the systolic, a tempest's roar as the heart doth contract, propelling the crimson flood; and the diastolic, a gentler susurrus when the heart reposes, allowing vessels to gently recoil. This rhythmic ebb and flow, a ballet of force, is vital to the carriage of sustenance and the expulsion of waste throughout the realm of our being.

##  The Guardian's Vigil: Normal Ranges

A Paladin, ever vigilant, must discern the markers of wellbeing.  For healthy blood pressure, the systolic should not exceed an hundred and twenty upon the graduated scale, whilst the diastolic resteth below eighty.  These, dear reader, are the hallowed bounds where vigor flourishes.

##  When the Tides Turn: Hypertension and Hypotension

**Hypertension**, a clandestine foe, arises when the systolic pressure persistently breaches the ordained limit, a chronic assault upon the arterial walls. Neglect this, and maladies such as coronary afflictions and strokes may befall.  **Hypotension**, its inverse, sees pressure dip too low, leading to dizziness, weakness, and a dimming of the vital spark. Both extremes require the Paladin's heed and the healer's art.

##  Lifestyle's Arsenal:  Combatting Imbalance

Like a valiant knight arming himself, one can  counter blood pressure's disquiet through lifestyle:

*   **Diet:**  A regimen rich in verdure, whole grains, and lean provisions, whilst paring back salt and excess fat, shall fortify the circulatory system.
*   **Exercise:**  Regular bodily exertion, a noble pursuit, strengthens the heart and aids in pressure regulation.
*   **Stress Management:**  The mind's tempest can impact the body's tides. Meditation, repose, and mindfulness  prove potent weapons against stress's  grip.
*   **Refrain from Excess:**  Liquor and tobacco, insidious enemies,  further strain the cardiovascular  fortress. Their consumption must be eschewed.


Through understanding and righteous living, we may keep blood pressure in harmonious balance, a testament to the Paladin's creed of health and wellbeing.
