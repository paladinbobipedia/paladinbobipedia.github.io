# Square

*A humble paragon of geometry, foursquare in form and steadfast in its virtue, the Square doth stand as a testament to order amidst the chaos. A beacon of regularity, it guides the hand of the architect and the mind of the scholar, ever reminding us of divine proportion.*

## Definition & Properties

Square, a term derived from the Latin "quadratus," signifying "four-angled," denoteth a polygon of utmost simplicity yet profound import. Four sides, aye, and four right angles, each measuring aright ninety degrees, compose its very essence.  These sides, of equal length, interlock with unyielding precision, forming a shape both balanced and immutable. Its area, calculated by multiplying side length upon itself (side * side), bespeaks a harmony of measure.

## Applications in the Realm

The utility of the Square transcends the confines of mere theoretical discourse. In the noble craft of masonry, it guides the laying of foundations, ensuring structures stand firm against the tempest's wrath.  Carpenters wield its form to fashion frames and joinery, whilst scribes employ it in drafting blueprints for grand edifices and intricate mechanisms. Even the celestial cartographers, mapping the heavens, find solace in the Square's guiding principles of symmetry and proportion.

## Symbolism & Allegory

Beyond its practical applications, the Square resonates with potent symbolism. It embodies steadfastness, integrity, and the pursuit of justice, mirroring the Paladin's unwavering oath.  Like a shield protecting the righteous, its four sides represent the pillars of virtue: Courage, Compassion, Wisdom, and Justice. Thus, the Square serves as a visual reminder of the ordered cosmos, reflecting the divine Architect's perfect design.
