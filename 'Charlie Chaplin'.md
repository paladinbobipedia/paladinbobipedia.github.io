*A Silent Bard, he wove tales of mirth and woe, with nimble limbs and visage ever-knowing.  Though tongue untied in spoken rhyme, his very essence sang a universal song, touching hearts from palace to pauper's door.  Chaplin, oh Chaplin, a maestro of motion, thy legacy echoes in laughter's timeless refrain.*

His early years, a crucible of hardship, forged a spirit of resilience and empathy, mely mirrored in the poignant humour he'd later bestow upon the world.

Through expressive gestures and a symphony of silent pantomime, The Tramp articulated the joys and sorrows of mankind, resonating with audiences across the globe.
