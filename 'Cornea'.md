# Cornea

**An Ode to the Lantern of the Soul**
_A crystal shield, 'gainst realms unseen, where light doth pierce the veil so keen. Cornea, thou art a window bright, reflecting heavens in mortal sight._

## Anatomy and Function

Cornea, a term derived from the ancient tongues signifying "horn,"  is a most wondrous convex lens, the outermost integument of the ocular orb. Forged of avascular, transparent tisue, it stands sentinel upon the sclerotic fortress, guarding the delicate humours within. This stalwart shield refracts the celestial luminescence, bending its path to focus upon the lens, thus enabling clear vision. Without Cornea's steadfast presence, the very act of perceiving the world's tapestry would be naught but a blurry, indistinct haze.

## Composition and Structure

This noble edifice comprises five distinct strata, each playing a crucial role in its efficacy:  
* **Epithelium:** A resilient outer layer, ever renewing itself, shielding from incursion.
* **Bowman's Layer:** A parchment-like shield, providing tensile strength.
* **Stroma:** The heart of Cornea, a latticework of collagen fibres, granting transparency and rigidity.
* **Descemet's Membrane:** A tenacious barrier, withstanding internal pressures.
* **Endothelium:** A monolayer of pump-like cells, ever vigilant in maintaining corneal hydration.  This intricate design ensures both durability and lucidity.

## Clinical Relevance - A Paladin's Vigil

As a Paladin sworn to aid the afflicted, I speak oft of corneal ailments.  Scars, abrasions, and infections, like vile monsters, threaten this vital organ.  Proper tending, with balms and purges, is paramount.  Furthermore, maladies such as keratitis and cataract, whilst  treacherous, yield to the skilled surgeon's art, restoring the light of hope to darkened eyes. Remember, a healed cornea is a soul granted clear vision upon the path of life.
