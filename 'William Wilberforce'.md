# William Wilberforce

*A Paragon of Mercy, 'Gainst Tyranny's Dark Stain*
In annals of virtue, where righteous deeds shine,
Stands Wilberforce, a beacon, most divine.
With voice of thunder, he championed the weak,
'Gainst slavery's shackles, his spirit did speak.  A soul aflame with God's own loving light,
He wrestled with shadows, and set wrongs to right.  His legacy, a testament, doth everlast,
A champion of freedom, forever to surpass.
