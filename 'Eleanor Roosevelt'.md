# Eleanor Roosevelt

**An Ode**
*A virtuous Lady, beacon bright, 'pon realms of human plight she shone,
With gentle hand and steadfast might, for justice, mercy, truth she'd hone.  Eleanor, a name that rings, through ages past, a champion sings.*

##  Early Life and Nobility

Dame Eleanor Roosevelt, born of lineage noble in the year of our Lord MDCCCCeight (1884), graced this earthly sphere as Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. A scion of the esteemed Roosevelt clan, kin to the illustrious President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, she inherited a spirit of service interwoven with her very being. Though beset by youthful trials – the passing of parents in tender years –  she blossomed into womanhood with a heart aflame for ameliorating the burdens of mankind. Her education, fostered within the hallowed halls of institutions such as Miss Chapin's School and later at Allenwood, instilled in her a keen intellect and a compassion that extended beyond societal bounds.

## A Paragon of Advocacy

Never content with mere aristocratic repose, Dame Eleanor embraced a path etched with activism. A champion of the downtrodden, she wielded her influence not as a gilded scepter, but as a shield protecting the vulnerable.  Her tireless advocacy resonated across myriad fronts: championing  workers' rights, advocating for racial equality, and lending her voice to the voiceless  during the Great Depression's dark shroud. Her "My Day" syndicated column, a platform of unparalleled reach, became a pulpit thundering forth messages of empathy and reform.  Furthermore, she fearlessly confronted societal ills,  prodding towards a more just and equitable world, a vision she tirelessly propagated through speeches and writings.

## Global Diplomacy and Unwavering Spirit

As First Lady, Dame Eleanor transcended the conventional role. A trusted confidante to her husband, President Roosevelt, she ventured forth as a diplomat,  her global tours fostering understanding amidst the turbulent tides of World War II. She championed human rights on an international stage,  a precursor to the very declaration that would bear her imprint years hence. Even in the face of personal grief and the world's chaos, her spirit remained unbent, a testament to her indomitable will and unwavering faith in humanity's potential for good. 

## Legacy Etched in Time

Eleanor Roosevelt's departure from this mortal coil in MDCCLXXXII (1962) marked not an ending, but a commencement of enduring influence. Her life, a tapestry woven with courage, compassion, and intellectual prowess, serves as a timeless exemplar. The United Nations enshrined her legacy by naming the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award in her honor, a perpetual tribute to her tireless fight for dignity and equality.  Dame Eleanor Roosevelt, a true Paladin of our time,  remains a shining star, guiding us towards a brighter, more humane world.
