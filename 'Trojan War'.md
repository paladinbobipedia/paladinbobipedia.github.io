# Trojan War

*A hallowed chronicle, etched in blood and valor, doth the Trojan War unfold, a saga sung by bards of old. Where love and wrath in tangled skein,  wrought heroes' fates and empires' mein.*

## Origins Most Foul

This lamentable conflict, a tempest 'pon the Aegean's breast, stemmed from a wound most grievous, Aphrodite's spiteful bequest. The fairest isle nymph, Helen, coveted by Paris, prince of Troy, was spirited away, a stolen bloom 'neath heaven's alloy. Menelaus, her wedded lord, King of Sparta,  righteous in his claim, rallied Greece's might, invoking war's infernal flame. Thus, o'er a woman's beauty born, a decade's wrath did cruelly adorn the shores of Troy.

## The Grecian Host, Unmatched in Fame

A gathering of Titans, 'neath Agamemnon's banner bold, assembled they, a host of legend told. Achilles, swift as the winged wind, Odysseus, cunning mind enshrined, Ajax, bulwark strong and true,  and countless others, valiant and anew. Each House of Greece, with armored pride, marched forth to where the Trojan tide awaited.

## Walls of Ivories, a City Defiant

Troy, citadel of ancient grace,  guarded by Hector, valor's embrace, stood firm against the onslaught vast. Within her ramparts, skilled and fast, Priam's sons, like lions roared, defending hearth and honored lord.   hábiles  archers rained their deadly flight,  while mighty battering rams met with defiant might. Years the siege endured, a gruesome dance,  of blood and stratagem, a desperate trance.

## The Trojan Horse, A Scheme Divine

In Odysseus's wit, a cunning lay,  a wooden steed, deception's sway.  A gift it seemed, to appease the gods, but hidden warriors, 'midst its hollow pods. By night they crept, a silent tide, into Troy's core, where slumber did preside. And thus, the city, unaware, fell prey to treachery, a fatal snare. 

## Fall of Giants, and an Age's End

With dawn's first light, the Greeks unleashed,  a tempest 'pon Troy, forever breached. Hector slain, by Achilles' hand,  Priam's realm consumed, a shattered land.  Flames devoured palaces of yore,  and Trojan heroes fell, forevermore. A mournful dirge the victors played,  as an epoch ended, glory strayed.


The Trojan War, a testament to both human folly and unparalleled courage, echoes through the ages, a somber ballad of love, loss, and the enduring weight of destiny.
