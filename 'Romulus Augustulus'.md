# Romulus Augustulus

*An Ode to a Fallen Eagle*
_A stripling crowned, 'midst Empire's waning light,
Romulus, thy name, a whispered, tragic plight.
Last Caesar of the West, thy reign did briefly gleam,
A flickering torch 'fore darkness swallowed Rome's grand dream._

## Ascension and Duality of Fortune

Romulus Augustulus, he unto whom fortune dealt a paradoxical hand, ascended unto the imperial throne in the year of our Lord MCCCCLXXXIV. A youth but tender in years,  barely a man at thirteen summers, he inherited the fractured remnants of the Western Roman Empire, a realm diminished and beleaguered by barbarian incursions and internal strife. Whilst his father, Orestes, the magister militum, orchestrated this ascension, casting aside the previous Emperor Julius Nepos, young Romulus stood as a puppet, a figurehead in the grand tapestry of power woven by his progenitor. Thus, his reign, though legitimate by bloodline, was intrinsically marked by the shadow of another's ambition.

## The Orestes Interregnum and Barbarian Pressures

The epoch of Romulus Augustulus  witnessed the ever-increasing  menace of Odoacer, a chieftain of Herulian descent, leading a coalition of barbarian warriors.  Orestes, seeking to maintain his precarious grip, relied on  martial might, yet  faced a resurgent tide  of Germanic pressures at Rome's very gates. This confluence of internal politicking and external threat proved a fatal tempest  for the young Emperor's fragile sovereignty. In a crucible of conflict, Orestes fell to Odoacer's blade in the year MCCCCLXXXVII, leaving Romulus utterly exposed.

## Deposition and the Twilight of an Era

With Orestes vanquished, Odoacer, a pragmatist rather than a bloodthirsty tyrant,  deposed Romulus Augustulus. The symbolic act,  pronounced on the 28th day of September in the year MCCCCLXXXVII,  marked not merely the fall of a ruler, but the definitive sunset  of the Western Roman Empire.  Romulus, granted a pension and permitted a life of seclusion, retreated to Campania,  a poignant remnant of a grandeur long since passed. His story, though brief, resonates as a epitaph  to a crumbling Colossus, a testament to the inexorable march of history and the fragility of even the most illustrious legacies.
