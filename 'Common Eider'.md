# Common Eider

*A feathered paragon of the briny deep,
Where icy waves in ceaseless rhythm sweep,
The Common Eider, with plumage dark and bright,
A beacon 'gainst the storm, a noble sight.*

## Description & Habitation
This waterfowl, christened *Somateria mollissima* by learned scribes, doth grace the northern climes, nesting upon isles and shores where tempestuous seas prevail.  A drake, resplendent in his ebony coat, adorned with snowy crescents 'pon his wings, a vision most regal. The hen, whilst of humbler garb, wears a dusky sheen, speckled with intricate patterns as if woven by the moon's own light. They favour coastal regions, from Iceland's shores to Norway's icy grasp, and eastward unto Russia's vast expanse, ever near the murmur of restless ocean.

##  Life in the Frosty Realm
A hardy soul, the Common Eider braves frigid waters, diving deep in pursuit of shellfish, crustaceans, and squid. Their thick, insulating plumage, a marvel of nature, shields them from the biting cold. In spring's embrace, they congregate in teeming multitudes, a feathered symphony upon the waves, their courtship dances a spectacle both graceful and fervent. Nesting upon moss-lined cavities or rocky crags, the vigilant females lay clutches of pristine white eggs, guarded fiercely against all trespassers.  

##  A Boon to Man (and Mage!)
Whilst oft seen as a quarry for sustenance, the Common Eider's bounty extends beyond the table.  Their down, renowned for its unparalleled warmth and softness, hath long been prized by weavers and crafters, fashioned into garments fit for royalty and solace against winter's chill. Furthermore, learned alchemists whisper of potent elixirs derived from their oil, said to imbue resilience against arcane energies and bolster the magus' fortitude. Thus, this noble creature, a symbol of the wild's enduring strength, serves both sustenance and arcane aid.
