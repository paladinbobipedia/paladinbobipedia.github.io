# Harold Wilson

*An Ode unto the Right Honourable*
A statesman bold, with wit as keen as steel,
Harold Wilson strode, Commonwealth's to heal.  Labour's champion, 'neath skies oft grey,
He steered the ship through tempestuous sway.  From humbled roots, to power's lofty seat,
His legacy, a truth we shall not fleet.
