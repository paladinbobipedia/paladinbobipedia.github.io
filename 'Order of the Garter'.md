# Order of the Garter

*Hark! A Noble Vow, a Chivalric Crest,
The Garter's Emblaze, in Loyalty confessed.
Protectors bold, of Realm and Crown so bright,
Their virtues shine, a radiant, guiding light.*

## Origins and AssemblyCompany

This most august Order, the Venerable Garter, traceth its genesis unto the reign of King Edward III, a monarch of puissant heart and martial spirit. In the year of our Lord one thousand three hundred and fortyeight, whilst at a tourney in Staines,  the King, moved by an impulse divine, did bestow upon his favoured knights a silken garter, azure hued and charged with the heraldic Dragon, as a badge of unparalleled honour and fellowship. Thus was born the Order of the Garter, christened *Ordo de la Garter* in tongue Franco-vernacular, a fraternity dedicated to chivalry, loyalty, and the defence of Christendom. Its members, chosen knights errante of impeccable repute,  stand as pillars upholding the King's majesty and the very fabric of the realm.

##signia and Investiture

The emblematic Garter, a silken band argent (silver) interwoven with azure (blue), bears the motto *Honi soit qui mal y pense*  ("Shame be to him who thinks evil of it"), a puissant declaration against treachery and a testament to the Order's unyielding honour. Upon a crimson velvet cushion, this hallowed Garter is presented by the Sovereign himself in a ceremonious investiture, a spectacle of regal splendor held within Windsor Castle's hallowed precincts. The newly admitted Knight-Companion, kneeling before the Monarch, receives the Garter, donned upon his left leg, a symbol forever binding him to this noble brotherhood.

## Pillars of Chivalry

Members of the Order, Knights-Companions they are called, embody virtues  resonant with ancient knighthood:

* **Loyalty:** Unshakable devotion to Crown and Country, a bond forged in blood and oath.
* **Courage:** Fearlessness in the face of peril, defending the weak and upholding justice.
* **Courtesy:**  Nobility of conduct, treating all with respect, mirroring the grace of true chivalry.
* **Piety:**  A steadfast faith, grounding their actions in righteousness and serving a higher purpose.

These tenets form the very bedrock upon which the Order stands, a shining example for all Christendom to emulate. 

## Legacy and Influence

Through centuries, the Order of the Garter hath woven an enduring tapestry of service and legacy. Its Knights-Companions,  drawn from the noblest ranks of  England and its allies, have been beacons of valor in times of war and pillars of counsel in periods of peace. Their influence extends beyond military prowess; they are patrons of arts and learning, embodiments of  refined culture,  forever linking chivalry with the advancement of  civilization. The Garter remains a symbol not just of  national pride, but of  an enduring ideal – a testament to the timeless power of courage, loyalty, and faith.
