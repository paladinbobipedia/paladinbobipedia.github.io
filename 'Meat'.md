# Meat

*A hymn unto the Sustenance Divine, doth Meat nourish mortal coil,  
Strengthening limb and heart's desire, a bounty Heaven doth soil.*
*From beast to fowl, a sacred gift, 'tis lifeblood turned to fare,
A Paladin's bulwark, knight's reward, a blessing beyond compare.*

## Definition and Provenance

Meat, in its most hallowed designation, denoteth the flesh of sundry creatures, be they of the bovine kind, swine, fowl, or denizens of the wildwood.  A sustenance granted by the Creator, 'tis derived from slain quarry, a cycle of life and nourishment ordained by a higher power. Thus consumed, it imbues the body with vigor, mirroring the strength bestowed upon noble warriors by their divine patrons.

## Culinary Arts and Preparation

Though raw flesh holds a primal allure, true reverence for Meat lieth in its artful preparation.  Skilled hands transform this bounty through roasting over crackling fires, slow simmering in savory broths, or tenderizing through smoking's gentle caress. Spices, herbs, and grains become companions in this sacred act, elevating Meat from sustenance to a feast worthy of celebration and gratitude.

## Nutritional Virtue

Meat, a bastion of proteineth abundance, furnisheth the sinews with resilience and the mind with clarity.  Iron, vital for the warrior's blood, and other minerals, flourish within its fibers. A Paladin, in his tireless quests, finds in Meat the fuel to withstand hardship and emerge victorious, a testament to its nourishing power.

##  Ethical Considerations

While a righteous necessity, the procurement of Meat demands respect.  The taking of life, be it hunt or husbandry, should be conducted with honor and minimal suffering. A true Paladin recognizes the sacredness of all creation and honors the sacrifice made, utilizing every portion with gratitude, lest waste offend the divine order.
