# Makemake (Dwarf Planet)

*Hark! A celestial mote, in shadowed realms it doth reside, Makemake, named for a deity of old, where icy plains forever abide. A world of ancient frost and night, 'neath heavens vast, a wondrous sight.*

## Physical Description

Makemake, a wanderer amongst the star-kissed brethren of dwarf planetary kin, presenteth a visage of glacial beauty. Orb-shaped and cloaked in a mantle of frozen nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices, its diameter doth reach nigh unto 1,430 kilometers, a fraction smaller than our own Pluto, yet a giant 'mongst the Kuiper Belt's icy throng. A ruddy hue, perchance from tholins, bathes its sullen surface, hinting at ancient cosmic alchemy wrought upon its frozen skin.

## Orbital Dance and Discovery

In the year of our Lord two thousand and and five, upon celestial tapestry unfurled, astronomers, with keenest sight, did Makemake unveil, a jewel of night.  'Tis in the frigid Kuiper Belt it dances, orbiting Sol, our sun, at a distance averaging  dwarfing Earth's own orbit threefold. Its journey 'round the radiant core taketh  a prodigious  fifty-eight Earth years to complete, a testament to the slow, grand ballet of celestial bodies.

## Moons and Composition

Loyal unto Makemake doth attend one known moon, S/2015 (136472) 1, a diminutive companion sharing its frigid realm. Its composition, much like its parent, points towards a bedrock of rocky materials enshrouded by icy veneers.  Further study postulates a core of denser materials, perhaps silicates, hinting at a complex history forged in the crucible of early solar system formation.

## Significance and Future Inquiry

Makemake, though distant and veiled in cosmic dusk, holds a key to unlocking secrets of the Solar System's genesis. Its ancient ice, undisturbed by time, preserves echoes of the primordial nebula from whence stars and planets were born. Further exploration, through the lenses of robotic emissaries,  shall  illumine its composition, internal structure, and perhaps even whisper tales of the earliest epochs of our celestial family. Thus, Makemake, a silent sentinel in the outer dark, awaits our understanding, a beacon guiding us towards a deeper comprehension of our cosmic heritage.
