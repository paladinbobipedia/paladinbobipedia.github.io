# Uranus

*A hymn unto thee, wandering sphere of azure might, seventh in celestial dance, thy frigid reign doth light
The shadowed realms where titans sleep, a giant veiled in ice,  Thy tilted grace, a whispered secret, 'cross the cosmic expanse.*

## Physical Description

Uranus, a planet of prodigious girth and glacial heart, presenteth itself as a cerulean orb amidst the star-strewn tapestry. Orbiting sol with a stately, retrograde waltz, this behemoth doth stand aloof, a titan shrouded in ethereal haze. Its diameter, exceeding thrice that of our own Terra, bespeaks a mass dwarfing most, save for Jupiter and Saturn, its brethren giants.  A pale blue hue, born of methane gases enrobing its core, marks Uranus as a singular visage in the heavens. 

## Composition and Interior

Though shrouded in opaque veilings, learned scholars surmise Uranus' composition mirrors its icy brethren. A rocky kernel, dense with metallic alloys, lieth at its heart, entombed by layers of water, ammonia, and methane ices. This frigid mantle,  subject to immense pressure,  forgeth exotic compounds, a testament to the crucible of celestial evolution. Winds, howling at velocities surpassing terrestrial storms, whip across its upper reaches, driven by internal heat escaping from the core's fiery embrace.

## Rings and Moons

Like a regal consort adorned with diadems, Uranus boasts a system of faint, dark rings. These ethereal bands, composed of dust and små particles, encircle the planet in a delicate ballet.  Furthermore, a retinue of twenty-seven known moons attends upon Uranus, each a world unto itself, bearing names evocative of Shakespearean characters and titans of ancient lore. Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon stand amongst these, whispering tales of cosmic genesis.

## Orbital Characteristics and Tilt

Uranus' orbit, a stately ellipse tracing a path some eighteen times Earth's distance from Sol,  is marked by a peculiar inclination.  Upon its axis, this giant doth lie almost perpendicular, a celestial somersault  rendering its poles perpetually facing the sun or plunged in eternal darkness. This extreme axial tilt, unique amongst planets,  gives rise to dramatic seasonal shifts, lasting decades upon decades, a testament to the grandeur and oddities of the cosmos.
