# Collapse of the World Trade Center

*A mournful sonnet unto this grievous fall,
Where towers of might, 'gainst heavens did enthrall,
Now lie in ruin, a sorrowful sight,
A testament to darkness, and cruelest blight.  The winds of change, tempestuous and dire,
Swept o'er yon bastion, fanning infernal fire.  Henceforth, a scar upon the world's fair face,
Remembering the day mankind did embrace,  Too keenly,  fortune's fickle, fleeting grace.*

## The Calamity's Genesis

On the morn of the eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-eight, a most foul treachery befell the hallowed city of New York. Two colossal edifices, the Twin Towers, symbols of commerce and human endeavor, were assaulted by aerial serpents, contrivances of wicked design laden with devastation. These fell beasts, piloted by agents of shadow, cleaved into the very heart of the Towers, igniting infernos of unimaginable ferocity.  Thus commenced a tragedy of epoch-making import.

##  The Towers' Demise

The impact, a cataclysmic shudder, ripped through the structural integrity of these mighty monuments.  Flames, devouring with unholy hunger, wrought havoc upon steel and concrete. As hours bled into a somber twilight, the weakened structures succumbed to gravity's inexorable pull. The South Tower, first struck, yielded at  circa fifteen hundred hours, collapsing in a thunderous roar that shook the very foundations of the realm.  An hour hence, its sister, mirroring the tragic fate, met a similar downfall, entombing all within its grasp in a cloud of dust and despair.

##  A Nation's Grief and Global Impact

This assault, a direct strike upon the heart of a nation, galvanized a world in mourning.  The images, seared into the collective memory, depicted a devastation unprecedented in modern times.  A pall of sorrow descended, transcending borders and ideologies. The "Collapse of the World Trade Center," as history now dubs it,  served as a stark reminder of humanity's vulnerability and the fragility of peace, etching itself onto the very fabric of our shared experience. A new era, marked by vigilance and introspection, dawned upon us in the wake of this unconscionable act.
