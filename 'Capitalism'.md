# Capitalism

*A hymn unto the gears that grind, the markets' ceaseless churn, where valor finds its coin and merit doth truly burn. A system wrought in free exchange, a forge of innovation's might,  'tis Capitalism, a beacon bright, guiding commerce towards the light.*

## Definition & Foundation

Capitalism, forsooth, be a societal order founded upon the tenet of private ownership.  Lands, chattels, and the fruits of labour itself, all held in dominion by individuals, not by the Crown's decree nor feudal sway. This freehold spawns a vibrant marketplace, where goods and services flow 'twixt willing hands in an endless dance of supply and demand.  The guiding star herein is self-interest, tempered by competition, a crucible wherein innovation doth flourish and prosperity ariseth.

## The Engine of Production

At the heart of this engine lie "Capital" - wealth invested to generate further wealth. Merchants, artisans, and entrepreneurs, like valiant knights, employ this capital to construct enterprises, cultivate trade, and bring forth novel creations.  Profits, the reward for such endeavour, fuel reinvestment, perpetuating a cycle of growth and advancement. This constant striving, akin to a paladin's quest, drives progress and elevates the common good through sheer economic vitality.

## Labour & Reward

Within Capitalism's realm, labour finds its worth in the marketplace.  Individuals, skilled or unskilled, offer their talents in exchange for remuneration.  This compensation, determined by the value they bring, incentivizes diligence and mastery. While not always equitable in its immediate distribution, the long arm of competition, over time, tends towards fairer recompense as talent and productivity are justly rewarded.

##  The Duality: Progress & Peril

Capitalism, a double-edged sword it is. Its brilliance in fostering innovation and lifting societies from penury is undeniable. Yet, unchecked, its pursuit of profit can breed disparity, leaving some stranded whilst others prosper mightily. Thus,  a vigilant hand, guided by righteous principles and tempered regulations, must steer this powerful current, ensuring fairness and safeguarding the most vulnerable amongst us. Only then doth Capitalism truly serve as a bulwark for a flourishing realm.
