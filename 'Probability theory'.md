# Probability Theory

*Hark, ye seekers of knowledge, for in the tapestry of the cosmos, where Fate's loom weaves intricate patterns, dwelleth a noble discipline known as Probability Theory. A beacon 'gainst the tempestuous sea of the unknown, it illuminateth the likelihood of events, granting us a glimpse into the whispers of chance itself. A potent tool, wielded by sage and scholar, to decipher the subtle dances of fortune.*

## Definition & Foundations

Probability Theory, in its essence, doth grapple with the quantification of likelihood. 'Tis the art of assigning numerical weights, termed probabilities, to sundry occurrences, ranging from the mundane toss of a coin to the cosmic ballet of celestial movements.  Its bedrock rests upon axioms, postulates as firm as a Paladin's oath: that probabilities range from nought (assured impossibility) to unity (certitude), and that the sum of probabilities for exhaustive and mutually exclusive events equals unity itself.

## Events & Sample Spaces

Consider, gentle reader, a "sample space," a comprehensive inventory of all possible outcomes in a given trial or experiment.  An example hereof would be the casting of dice; the sample space comprises the faces numbered one through six.  Within this space lie "events," subsets of outcomes.  Landing on an even number, for instance, constitutes an event. Probability then speaks to the relative size of this event within the encompassing sample space.

##  Calculating Probabilities

Through the crucible of logic and arithmetic, we fashion probabilities.  The probability of an event is computed as the number of favorable outcomes (those constituting the event) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (the cardinality of the sample space). Thus, the probability of rolling a 'three' with a fair die is 1 (one favorable outcome) divided by 6 (total outcomes), yielding a probability of 1/6.

##  Compound & Conditional Probabilities

Life's intricacies often weave events in complex tapestries.  "Compound probabilities" address the likelihood of multiple events occurring, be it drawing a king followed by a queen from a deck (with replacement). "Conditional probabilities" delve into the likelihood of an event given that another has already transpired –  the probability of drawing a spade *knowing* the first card drawn was a heart (without replacement). These branches enrich our understanding of interconnected occurrences.


Probability Theory, a noble pursuit, empowers us to navigate the veil of uncertainty with newfound clarity. May its precepts guide thy decisions and illuminate the paths yet untrodden.
