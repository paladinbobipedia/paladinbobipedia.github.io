# Death

*A sable shroud o'er mortal coil doth fall,
  A hush descends, answering Time's silent call.
Though dreadsome visage, yet a solace deep,
For weary souls, in slumber eternal sleep.*

## The Undeniable Verity

Death, a decree as ancient as Creation's dawn,  is an immutable truth woven into the very fabric of existence. No lord, nor lady, peasant nor prince, doth escape its inexorable grasp. It is the final portal, a passage all mortals traverse, marking the cessation of earthly sojourn and the commencement of the hereafter, be it celestial paradise or shadowy netherworld. To deny Death's dominion is to folly indulge, for even the mightiest warrior, felled by blade or pestilence, bows to its sovereign sway.

## Manifestations and Harbingers

Whilst Death itself remaineth an unseen entity, its approach oft wears a veil of somber portent. Withering blooms, mournful whispers on the wind, and a chilling stillness precede its arrival, heralding a transition betwixt life's vibrant tapestry and eternity's silent loom.  Sometimes, grim messengers like the pallid Raven or the wan Moon in eclipse foreshadow its touch, reminding us of life's fleeting nature.

## The Soul's Passage

Upon the final exhale, the mortal shell doth surrender, and the ethereal essence, the soul, embarks on its pilgrimage.  Faiths diverge in their depictions of this transit, some envisioning a swift passage to the divine, others a  judgement, and yet more, a winding journey through shadowy realms.  Regardless the path,  the soul, freed from its corporeal bonds,  ventures forth into the mysteries beyond our earthly ken.

## A Paladin's Perspective

As a Paladin, sworn to righteousness and  protector of the innocent, I view Death not solely as an adversary but as a constant companion on life's journey. While we strive to vanquish ills and shield the living, we understand Death's inevitability. Our courage lies in embracing this truth,  offering solace to the dying, honoring their memory, and living  lives worthy of facing Death's embrace with  unyielding faith. For in its shadow, the valor of a righteous life shines brightest.
