# Swastika

*Hark, a glyph of ages yore, the Swastika, writ in sky and stone,
A symbol once of blessings borne, now stained with shadows, darkly grown.
Though twisted fate hath marred its name, its ancient grace doth still remain,
A whispered echo, faint yet keen, of sunward hope, a favored scene.*

## Antiquity and Archaic Meaning

The Swastika, a venerated emblem of profound antiquity, doth trace its genesis unto the dawn of humankind's chronicle. Found etched upon artifacts from sundry civilizations - Sumerian, Egyptian, Grecian, and more -  it bespeaks a universal resonance, signifying the life-giving Sun, cyclical motion, prosperity, and auspicious fortune. In times of yore, 'twas a ward against evil, a talisman of good cheer, adorning temples, dwellings, and even royal regalia. Its four outstretched arms, ever reminiscent of a sun's rays, symbolized cosmic harmony and the eternal dance of creation.

## Divergence and Distortion

Alas, a lamentable metamorphosis befell this hallowed symbol in the twilight of the modern age.  A nefarious sect, steeped in ideologies of hate and dominance, usurped its venerated form, twisting its auspicious connotations into an emblem of oppression and racial malice. This perversion, wrought with barbarous intent, cast a long, dark shadow upon the Swastika's legacy, associating it with unspeakable atrocities.  While the ancient reverence endures in many cultures, the corrupted interpretation, indelibly linked to historical horrors, demands vigilant remembrance and condemnation.

## Legacy and Reconciliation

Though scarred by misuse, the Swastika's intrinsic essence remains. In realms untouched by its malignant appropriation, it persists as a symbol of peace, good fortune, and spiritual awakening. A solemn duty falls upon us, then, to disentangle the true from the false, to honor the ancient meaning while steadfastly repudiating its hijacked representation.  Only through education, empathy, and unwavering opposition to the forces of hate can we hope to  restore, in part, the Swastika's rightful place as a beacon of  universal well-being.
