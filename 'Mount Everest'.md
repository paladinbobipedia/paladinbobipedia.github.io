A frosted monarch, 'cross whose peak God's own hand
Hath sculpted grandeur, reaching for the divine light.

Jagged ridges, like ancient dragon spines, pierce the heavens, whilst glaciers, tongues of crystalline ice, serpentinely descend its flanks.

Their ascent, a saga of grit and grace,  echoes the unwavering pursuit of noble aspirations.
