# Easter

*Hark! Atide this blessed morn, when vernal hues doth paint the land,*
*And feathered choir their anthems raise, a joy throughout the strand.  Easter cornea, Resurrection's light, banishing winter's icy hand. A season of rebirth, where faith takes flight!*

## The Sacred Observance

Easter, a solemnity of paramount import within the Christian creed, commemorates the glorious Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the hallowed sepulchre. On this morn, declared the first Sunday successivo unto the Paschal Full Moon, we celebrate His triumph o'er mortality, a beacon of everlasting hope kindled for all mankind. 'Tis a feast day rich in symbolism, mirroring Christ's ascension and the burgeoning of spring, a testament to life's enduring victory.

## Traditions & Rites

The observance of Easter unfolds with ancient and cherished customs.  From solemn vigils held on Holy Saturday, anticipating the dawn's first light, to fervent processions bearing aloft the Paschal Candle, a symbol of Christ's radiant presence – each act speaks volumes. Joyous bells peal forth, announcing the Resurrection's tidings, whilst decorated eggs, emblems of new life, and rabbits, symbolizing fertility, grace our feasts.  Families gather, sharing blessed meals and partaking in acts of charity, mirroring the boundless love Christ bestowed.

## Scriptural Foundation

Easter's bedrock lies in the sacred scriptures. The Gospels recount the harrowing Passion, culminating in Christ's crucifixion, followed by His descent into the realm of shadows. Yet, on the third day, as foretold, He rose victorious, appearing to disciples and shattering the bonds of death. This miraculous event, witnessed by many and proclaimed throughout the ages, forms the very core of our Easter faith – a promise of eternal life through Him. 

##  A Paladin's Perspective

As a Paladin sworn to uphold righteousness and vanquish darkness, I view Easter as a potent reminder. Christ's Resurrection embodies the unwavering triumph of good over evil. It fuels our courage to combat injustice, mirroring His own battle against death itself. Just as spring blossoms forth after winter's grip, so too does hope flourish in our hearts, inspiring us to serve with valor and compassion, forever guided by the light of Easter's glorious dawn.
