# Gift

*A hallowed boon, a celestial grace, Gift doth weave its threads through time and space, A tapestry of kindness, bright and bold, A whispered prayer, a story to be told.*

## Definition & Essence

Gift, in its purest form, is an bestowal  of valor,  aribute, or solace, unasked and freely given. 'Tis not a mere transaction of wares nor coin, but a radiant emanation of  good will,  akin to the sun's warm kiss upon the frosted morn. Whether manifested as material aid,  words of comfort, or acts of selfless daring, a true Gift carries the weight of  noble intention and  ethereal light. 

## Divine Origin & Manifestations

Many hold Gift to spring from the very wellspring of  the Creator, a facet of His boundless mercy  trickling down to mortals.  Thus, it may  manifest in sundry fashions: a healer's touch mending grievous wounds, a bard's song inspiring courage, or a knight's shield safeguarding the weak. Even the smallest kindness, a shared loaf amidst famine,  can embody this divine  Gift.

## The Paladin's Vow & Gift

Paladin, sworn servant of righteousness,  sees Gift as a cornerstone of their sacred duty. We are  charged to be conduits of this benevolence,  ever vigilant in offering succor and defense. Our  strength is not merely  in blade and armor, but in the  Gifts we dispense: protection  to the innocent, justice  to the wronged, and hope  to the despairing. This is the true measure of a Paladin's valor.

## Recognizing & Honoring the Gift

Beware the counterfeits!  A Gift given with ulterior motive,  seeking praise or profit,  loses its sanctity. True Gift is  unburdened, selfless.  Recognize it in quiet gestures,  bold sacrifices, and the  unwavering light of compassion in another's heart. Honor it  with gratitude, emulation, and  a  lifespan dedicated to spreading its  radiant flame.
