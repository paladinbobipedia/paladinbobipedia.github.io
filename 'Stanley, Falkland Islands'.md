# Stanley, Falkland Islands

*A hymn unto this isle remote, where wind doth whip the restless main,
Stanley stands, a beacon bright, 'midst tempest's roar, a stalwart strain.
Though distant from the realm's embrace, her spirit soars, a valiant strain,
A bastion 'gainst the ocean's wrath,  where duty calls, and honor's reign.*
