# New Hampshire

*Hark, a hallowed realm doth rise 'pon yon northernmost crest, where granite bones grip heavens' embrace and frosted winds forever jest. New Hampshire, a shire of valiant spirit, where woods whisper ancient lore, and liberty's flame doth ever burn, a beacon evermore.*

Fertile valleys, cradled by these mighty sentinels, yield bounty to the industrious yeoman.  Flowing through this verdant tapestry, rivers like the Merrimack, silver serpents winding, nourish the land and lend a cadence of liquid music unto the wild.  The Atlantic's restless sigh caresses her southeastern border, a constant reminder of the vast world beyond.
