# Chickenpox

*An Ode to the Vexing Itch*
A pox most curious, sent from heavens high,  
Though torment it doth bring, a badge of youthful nigh.
Chickenpox, they call thee, with blisters red and bright,
A trial by fire, ushering in resilience's light.

## Nature of the Affliction
This pestilence, Chickenpox, is wrought by a spritely fiend named Varicella Zoster, a virus most mischievous. 'Tis airborne in its nature, spreading through coughs and sneezes like whispers on the wind.  A plague oft encountered in tenderlings, it manifests in an eruption of vesicles, small, fluid-filled sacs resembling nascent chicks, hence the moniker. These blemishes, whilst itchy and vexing,  dry and scab over, leaving a tapestry of remembrance upon the skin.

## Symptoms Heraldry
Know ye the signs, for timely heed doth save:
* **Fever's Flame:** A warming first, a precursor brave.
* **Blistered Bloom:** Upon the flesh, the pox appear, a scattering bright.
* **Itch's Scourge:** A maddening tickle, driving souls to slight.
* **Malaise's Shadow:** Weakness may grip, a wearying plight.

##  The Paladin's Counsel
Though fear not, for this trial, though trying, is transient. Rest, gentle hydration, and soothing balms applied with care shall ease the discomfort. Quarantine, a wise decree, prevents further spread amongst the populace.  Seek the wisdom of learned physicians, they possess remedies to temper the fever's bite and allay the itch's wrath. Remember,  child, this affliction, whilst troublesome, often leaves behind immunity, a shield 'gainst future attacks. Thus, endure bravely, for in overcoming, strength is found.
