# Swan

*A feathered paragon, on waters serene it doth glide,
A symbol of grace, with plumage most wide.
In argent and ebony, a regal display,
O swan, thy beauty brightens each sun-kissed day.*

## Physical Description

The swan, a creature of noble bearing, presenteth a majestic silhouette upon the mirrored expanse of lakes and rivers. Its alabaster form, oft adorned with ebony wingtips, betokens a majesty derived from heavens themselves. A swan's neck, elongated and sinuous, curves with an elegance unmatched, culminating in a gracefully curved beak of ivory hue.  Powerful wings, spanning impressive lengths, speak to its aerial prowess, though its favoured domain resteth upon the tranquil waters. Feathered tresses, dense and glossy, shimmer like spun moonlight, lending an air of ethereal luminescence.

## Habitat and Behaviour

These aquatic knights favour freshwater habitats - tranquil meres, winding rivers, and placid ponds.  They congregate in stately flocks, their resonant calls echoing through the stillness, a symphony of nature's choir. Though seeming placid, swans exhibit fierce protectiveness over their progeny and nesting grounds, defending them with resolute courage. Their graceful swimming belies a surprisingly strong underbelly, propelling them through the water with effortless power.

## Symbolic Significance

Throughout ages, the swan hath been enshrouded in allegory. A emblem of purity, grace, and enduring love, it graces many a tapestry of myth and legend.  In heraldry, its presence signifies loyalty, nobility, and spiritual aspiration. Its transformative nature, moulting into resplendent plumage, mirrors the soul's evolution towards enlightenment.  Verily, the swan stands as a living embodiment of ethereal beauty and steadfast virtue.
