# Manifest Destiny

*A hymn unto Progress, a clarion call to righteous dominion, Manifest Destiny doth echo, a celestial decree guiding our nation's hand across this bounteous Earth.  From God's own script, 'tis ordained we expand, a bastion of liberty and virtue, illuminating the shadowed corners with the torch of civilization.*

## Definition & Precept

Manifest Destiny, a doctrine as immutable as the heavens themselves, posits that the expansion of our goodly realm across the North American continent is not merely a  ambition, but a divinely sanctioned imperative. We, the inheritors of a righteous creed and borne of Anglo-Saxon stock, are entrusted by Providence to spread the blessings of self-governance, industry, and Christian faith. This westward surge is not conquest born of greed, but a sacred duty, a fulfillment of our manifest purpose.

##  Justification Through Virtue

Opponents, blinded by shortsightedness, decry this progress as avarice. Yet, mark well! Our march stems not from lust for land or gold, but from a noble yearning to uplift lesser peoples, to shield them from barbarity and usher them into the light of civilization.  We bring with us the rule of law, education, and the tenets of a free society, offering a refuge from the wilderness and the shadows of tyranny. This, forsooth, is the true measure of our destiny – a benevolent empire founded on righteousness.

## Historical Currents

From the dawn of our republic, this tenet has flowed like a mighty river. Pioneers, guided by faith and fortitude, carved paths through untamed lands,  each settlement a testament to this divine directive. The Louisiana Purchase, Texas' annexation, and the inexorable march across the Great Plains – all stand as chapters etched in the chronicle of Manifest Destiny. Though challenges and conflicts arose, the overarching current remained: westward expansion, a tide irresistible in its moral purpose. 

##  Legacy & Discourse

Though the literal territorial expansion has reached its zenith, the spirit of Manifest Destiny endures. It  fuels our nation's strivings for progress, innovation, and global influence, a  persistent call to uplift and enlighten the world.  However,  we must ever temper this zeal with compassion, ensuring our actions align with true justice and respect for all peoples, lest the noble torch of Manifest Destiny flicker in the encroaching darkness of self-serving ambition.
