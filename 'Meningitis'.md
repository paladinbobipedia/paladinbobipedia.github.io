# Meningitis

*A pox most foul, a serpent 'neath the skull it weaves,
Meningitis, thy wrath doth chilling terror breathe. Inflaming membranes, stealing wit and light,
A pestilence that claims the young and strong in night.*

##  Nature of the Affliction

Meningitis, a grievous malady, doth assail the very fortress of man's mind - the meninges, silken sheaths encasing the sacred brain. This pestilence, oft wrought by mischievous spirits (bacteria or virus in vulgar tongue), provoketh inflammation within these protective layers.  A tempest brews, causing swelling and torment, threatening the citadel of consciousness itself.

##  Symptoms, O Signs Foreboding

Recognize ye the heraldry of this dark visitor: fever's fiery brand, a throbbing cephalalgia (headache) fierce as dragon's breath, and stiffening of the neck, a frozen sentinel guarding a besieged mind.  Delirium may cloud the ragione, whilst rashes, like blossoms of blight, sometimes bloom upon the skin. In tender babes, lethargy and  refusal to feed serve as dire warnings.

##  The Paladin's Path: Diagnosis and Aid

To vanquish this foe, swift discernment is key. Maisters of healing (physicians) shall probe with gentle hands and scrutinize the afflicted's state.  Fluids, purgation, and rest, pillars of initial defense.  Should the culprit be a bacterial legion, potent antidotes (antibiotics) must be wielded, administered with the Paladin's zeal against unholy blight. Viral incursions demanda different armory, focused on easing suffering whilst the body's own defenses prevail.

##  Prevention, a Vigil Kept

Though no absolute shield exists, vigilance can temper this scourge. Vaccinations, blessings forged in science, offer potent protection against certain demonic strains.  Hygiene, a Paladin's constant companion,  keepeth foul spirits at bay through hand-washing and sanitation. In crowded quarters, wary observance  prevents  further spread. 


Remember, good folk, meningitis, though fearsome, is not invincible. With timely recognition, the Healer's art, and the bulwark of prevention, we may shield ourselves and our kin from its icy grip.
