# Scots Law

*Hark, a hymn to Scotia's ancient right, Scots Law doth stand, a beacon burnished bright, Through feudal strands and monarch's ancient sway,  Justice it dispenseth, come what may.*

## Genesis and Guises

Scots law, a tapestry woven from threads of Roman bequest, Celtic custom, and the crown's own decree, hath evolved o'er centuries, a unique fabric in these Isles. Whilst kindred to its English neighbour, 'tis distinguished by a soul peculiarly its own, nurtured in the fertile fields of Scottish tradition. Its roots delve deep into immemorial times, mirroring the nation's hardy spirit, enshrined in pronouncements and practices passed down through generations, a living legacy echoing in hallowed courts.  For in this realm, common law doth intertwine with statute, forming a dualistic structure, where precedent and legislative edicts dance in harmonious discourse.

##  The King's Bench and Parliament's Hand

   Unlike realms where Chancery holds sway, Scots law finds its bedrock in the venerable Court of Session, a tribunal established by Parliament's puissant hand in the sixteenth century. This august body, with its Inner House and Outer House, acts as the apex of civil jurisdiction, interpreting statutes and precedents with sagacity.  Parliament,  the embodiment of the nation's voice,  forgeth the statutes that shape the legal landscape, a testament to the symbiotic relationship between the legislative and judicial branches.

##  Custum and Stair - A Tapestry Unfurled

   A salient feature distinguishing Scots law is its profound reverence for "custum,"  the living customs and practices of the land. These ancient tenets,  borne on the winds of history,  find formal expression in the codified body of jurisprudence known as "Stair." Compiled by Sir Thomas Stair in the seventeenth century, this monumental work  catalogs legal principles,  a veritable encyclopedia of Scots legal thought,  interweaving custom with evolving legal doctrines.

##  Clerks of Court and Writs of Action

   Within the hallowed halls of justice, the "clerks of court"  play a vital role, meticulously recording proceedings and ensuring the due process of law.  Actions commence not with mere petitions, but through  "writs of action,"  formal instruments invoking the court's authority. These writs,  each tailored to a specific legal claim,  set the stage for adversarial proceedings, where parties present their cases with rigor and eloquence.


Thus, Scots law, a bastion of tradition tempered by progress, stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of Scotland, a legacy worthy of both reverence and study.
