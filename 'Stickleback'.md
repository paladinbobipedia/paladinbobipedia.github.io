*In shadowed depths it guards, a bastion bright,*
*Stickleback, defender, a radiant knight.*

## Description

Stickleback, a piscine denizen oft encountered in brackish waters and crystal streams, presenteth a visage both unassuming and formidable. Clad in shimmering scales of argent and viridian, its diminutive stature belies a heart courageous as any lion's.  A singular, elongated dorsal fin, resembling a nascent lance, protrudes proudly, serving as both defense and a symbol of its resolute nature. Notably, male Sticklebacks, in the throes of courtship, adorn themselves with brilliant crimson hues upon their bellies, a flamboyant display of martial valor.
