# Typewriter

*A hymn unto the clicking cogs, where quill's grace finds metallic tongue, a herald of the word, swift and strong, the Typewriter doth our discourse prolong.*

The Operator, wielding nimble fingers, engageth the myriad keys, each corresponding to a distinct character.  Pressure upon these triggers a delicate choreography:  levers actuated, hammers raised, inked ribbon kissed, leaving indelible marks upon the ever-unfurling sheet below.  A carriage, propelled by mechanism, advances with each line completed, a rhythmic dance mirroring the scribe's progress. This tireless automaton grants mankind the power to dispatch missives and chronicle tales at a pace unmatched by the traditional quill.
