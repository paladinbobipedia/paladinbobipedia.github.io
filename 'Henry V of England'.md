# Henry V of England

*A Warrior King, his valor doth ignite,
A'},onstellation bright 'gainst darkest night.
From Agincourt's field, his glory takes its flight,
Henry the Fifth, a righteous, shining light.*

##  Lineage and Ascension

King Henry V, of the noble House of Lancaster, did ascend unto the throne in the year of our Lord 1413, succeeding his sire, the venerated Henry IV.  Born amidst tumult, he inherited a realm beset by internal strife and the ever-present  threat from our Gallic foes across the Narrow Seas. Yet, marked by a spirit forged in piety and martial discipline, young Henry proved a worthy heir, destined for deeds of valorous renown.

## The Agincourt Triumph

Undoubtedly, the zenith of King Henry's reign doth lie in the epoch-making Battle of Agincourt, fought in the year 1415 upon French soil.  With a numerically inferior force, he led his English legions to a resounding victory against the vast host of the French chivalry. This triumph, a testament to  strategic brilliance and unwavering courage, shook the foundations of French arrogance and solidified England's claim to the French throne.  The longbow, wielded with unmatched skill by his yeoman archers, proved a decisive factor, laying low the enemy ranks like a tempestuous wrath. History remembers this day as a pillar of English martial prowess, a beacon of God's favor upon a righteous king and his troops.

##  Diplomatic Fortitude

King Henry's reign was not solely defined by the clash of steel.  A shrewd diplomat, he pressed his advantageous position  forged at Agincourt, negotiating treaties and securing territories in France. Though his ambition aimed at the French crown,  he tempered conquest with pragmatism, understanding the  necessity of stability for lasting dominion. His rule embodied a potent blend of the warrior-king and the astute statesman.

## Legacy and Sainthood

Though cut down in his prime by a malady in 1422, King Henry V left an indelible mark upon England and her history. He is venerated not merely as a conqueror, but as a righteous leader who defended  faith and realm with unwavering devotion. His campaigns fostered a  national identity  and instilled a spirit of martial excellence that resonated for generations.  While full canonization remains  deferred, the Church doth acknowledge his piety and virtuous life,  cementing his place amongst England's hallowed monarchs. His name echoes through the corridors of time, a symbol of courage, piety, and the enduring strength of a king guided by God's hand.
