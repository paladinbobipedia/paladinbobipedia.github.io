# Beriberi

*A pox upon scurvy's kin, Beriberi doth creep,*
*With stealthy touch, on limbs it doth leap,*
*A thief of strength, a blight on the hearty,*
*A malady scorned, yet oft-felt dearly.*

## Nature of the Affliction

Beriberi, a grievous ailment stemming from insufficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1), afflicts mankind with dire consequences. This deficiency, oft born of a diet bereft of whole grains and legumes, doth化作 a tempest within the body's very framework. It particularly targets the nervous system and the cardiovascular apparatus, bringing forth a wretched tapestry of symptoms.

## Manifestations of Woe

The cruel hand of Beriberi presents itself in twain principal guises: **dry beriberi** and **wet beriberi**.  Dry beriberi, a scourge upon the nerves, manifests in crippling weakness, numbness tingling in the extremities, and a staggering gait reminiscent of a drunken soul.  Wet beriberi, more insidious, assaults the heart and vessels, breeding swollen limbs, palpitations, and a shortness of breath that steals the very joy of life. In its advanced stages, both forms may lead unto cardiac failure, a grim reaper's embrace.

## A Paladin's Plea: Prevention and Remedy

Though Beriberi casts a long shadow,  a valiant knight armed with knowledge can combat its encroachment.  A diet rich in thiamine-laden provisions, such as barley, brown rice, nuts, and enriched grains, stands as the bulwark against this foe.  Should the malady take hold, supplemental thiamine, administered with the healer's skill, offers a path to recovery.  Remember, good folk, awareness and proper sustenance are our mightiest weapons against this insidious affliction!
