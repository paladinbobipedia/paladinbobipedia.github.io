# Epilepsy

*An ill visitation, yet not of foul demon, but a tempest within the sacred vessel of the mind, Epilepsy doth strike with sudden, fiery wracks, leaving naught but bewildered stillness in its wake. A trial, certes, but one that doth not diminish the spirit's valor.*

## Nature of the Affliction
Epilepsy, a malady oft termed the "Falling Sickness" in common tongue, is a perturbation of the very essence governing mortal motion and cognition.  'Tis a discordance within the brain's ethereal circuitry, causing surges of aberrant electrical impulses. These, like rogue lightning, disrupt the harmonious flow of thought and bodily control, manifesting in seizures of varying intensity.  Some endure mere tremors and fleeting unsteadiness, whilst others fall prey to grand convulsions, a spectacle both fearsome and pitiable.

## Manifestations of the Tempest
The visage of an epileptic fit varies as wildly as the storms of heaven.  Frequent are the convulsive spasms, contortions unnatural, and the loss of consciousness, a temporary eclipse of the soul.  Other times, subtle tremors, staring spells, or unbidden utterances mark the affliction's passage. These seizures, though unsettling, are never indicative of malevolent possession, but rather a tempest brewing within the mortal frame.

## Causes Unveiled (or Obscured)
Though the precise genesis of this inner tempest remains shrouded in some mystery, learned physicians posit links to imbalances in the humors,  inherited predispositions, or injuries impacting the brain's delicate structure.  Fever, stress, and even sensorial excesses  may act as triggers, fanning the flames of this internal discord.

## A Paladin's Path to Aid
Fear not, for though Epilepsy's nature is complex, compassion and aid are our weapons!  We, the stalwart of faith, must approach with empathy, never scorn.  During a seizure, ensure safety from harm, restrain with gentleness, and attend to their awakening with solace. Sustenance and rest pós-seizure are vital, as is long-term care tending to any underlying causes  a healer might discern. Remember,  in aiding those with Epilepsy, we embody the truest tenets of our order:  protection, solace, and unwavering hope.
