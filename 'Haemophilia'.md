# Haemophilia

*A plague most foul, 'pon blood's sacred tide it doth dwell,
Haemophilia, a curse where clotting's maelstrom fails to swell.
Though valiant hearts may bear it, a hidden, grievous plight,
A king's own kin afflicted, robbed of life's robust might.*

##  Nature of the Affliction

Haemophilia, a pestilence inherited, striketh chiefly the noble line, rendering their blood most treacherous.  'Tis a malady where the coagulation process, that vital shield against grievous bleedings, falters in its duty. Absent or deficient are the clotting factors, proteins of paramount importance in stanching the flow when wounds do rend the flesh. Thus, even minor injuries may blossom into rivers of crimson, sapping strength and threatening life's very essence.

## Manifestations and Severity

This insidious ailment doth present in divers degrees. Some, marked by a gentle strain, suffer prolonged bleeding from cuts or after surgery. Others, gripped by a more dire form, experience hemorrhages spontaneous,  within joints or organs, a torment most cruel. The severity hinges upon the lacking clotting factor; Factor VIII deficiency, the commonest variant, dictates the  "Haemophilia A" nomenclature, whilst "Haemophilia B," linked to Factor IX deficiency, claims its share of afflicted souls.

##  Hereditary Transmission

Like a shadow passed through generations, Haemophilia travels the bloodlines. It be a recessive trait, meaning both parents must carry the tainted gene, though they themselves may show no symptoms, for the affliction to manifest in their offspring. A son, inheriting the flawed gene from his mother, stands most susceptible, whilst daughters, though carriers, rarely exhibit the full disease's wrath.  

##  Aid and Admonition

Though a grievous burden, despair not! With vigilant care and modern ministrations, lives touched by Haemophilia can flourish. Replacement therapy, supplying the missing clotting factors, offers a bulwark against excessive bleeding. Counsel from learned physicians, coupled with cautious lifestyle choices,  ameliorate the risks. This plague, though formidable, need not dictate a life of unending torment. Faith, fortitude, and timely intervention pave the path toward a more valiant existence.
