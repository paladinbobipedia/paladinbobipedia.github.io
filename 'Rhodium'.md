# Rhodium

*Hark, a hymn to Rhodium, metal of argent sheen,
A noble heart 'midst brethren, where radiance is seen.
From Earth's deep bosom wrought, 'tis proof against decay,
A paladin's steadfast grace, in brilliance it doth sway.*

## Provenance and Properties

Rhodium, a coinage most rare, doth hail from the bowels of our terrestrial sphere, oft intertwined with kindred spirits such as platinum and palladium. Its hue, a silvery-white, approaches the perfection of polished moonlight, lending an air of ethereal luminescence. This adamant substance boasts a strength exceeding many, resistant to corrosion's insidious touch and the ravages of time itself. A crucible's fire cannot subdue its form, nor doth acid erode its noble essence. Such fortitude doth make it a treasure coveted by craftsmen and alchemists alike.

##  Applications of  Exquisite Utility

Rhodium's virtues find expression in manifold applications.  Its mirroring surface, unmatched in reflectivity, graces lenses and mirrors, channeling the very light of day with unparalleled fidelity. In the realm of artistry, its resilience allows it to adorn intricate jewellery, a testament to enduring beauty.  Moreover,  master smiths employ its catalytic prowess in enhancing chemical reactions, a silent guardian in laboratories and manufactories.  A shield against tarnishing, it safeguards precious metals, preserving their lustre for ages hence.

##  A Paladin's Gem

For a paladin such as myself, Rhodium embodies virtues we hold dear. Its unwavering steadfastness mirrors our oaths, its resistance to decay speaks to our eternal vigilance. The brilliance it reflects symbolizes the light of justice we strive to bring forth. Though seldom wielded as a weapon in its pure form, Rhodium's essence,  infused in armor or etched upon blades, serves as a potent reminder of our unwavering courage and the radiant ideals we champion. Thus, Rhodium, a metal of both earthly strength and ethereal grace, stands as a worthy emblem of the paladin's creed.
