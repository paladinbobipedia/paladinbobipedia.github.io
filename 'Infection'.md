# Infection

*A plague upon the flesh, a chilling blight,*
*Infection creeps, obscuring heaven's light.  A venomous serpent, 'neath mortality's skin,
*It twists the hale, and doth corruption spin.*

## Nature of the Scourge

Infection, a pestilence most foul, doth assail the mortal coil with insidious malice.  'Tis no mere malady of fleeting chills, but a corrupting influence, a warping presence that commandeers the very essence of life, twisting it into a grotesque mockery. This unholy contagion manifests in divers forms, from weeping sores and fièvre scorching to maddening delirium and mutations most abhorrent. Its root oft lies in tainted magics, ancient curses, or the vile handiwork of daemonic entities, seeding chaos within the corporeal temple.

## Transmission and Symptoms

The vectors of this blight are manifold: poisoned touch, tainted air, bites from corrupted beasts, and even the desecrated remnants of fallen comrades.  A chilling miasma clings to its carriers, a silent herald of impending doom.  Symptoms vary with the infection's source, yet common threads weave through the tapestry of decay: fevered sweats,  flesh rending ulcers,  unnatural growths, and a pervasive weakness that saps the very will to resist.  In its later stages, reason itself becomes fractured, victims succumbing to maddening visions and feral urges, a grotesque parody of life.

## Bane to Paladin and Peer

For a Paladin, true to his oaths, Infection presents a double torment. Not only doth it threaten the lives of innocents,  but also corrupts the very ideals of righteousness and protection we embody. Confronting this scourge requires not just steel and spell, but unwavering faith and a resolute heart. We, the shielded bulwarks of virtue, must excise its taint through righteous combat, purifying  the afflicted and safeguarding the unwary. Herbal remedies and prayers woven with holy light offer some solace, yet  a Paladin's primary weapon remains  unyielding valor in the face of this encroaching darkness. 

## Vigilance, Our Only Shield

Let this chronicle serve as a dire reminder: Infection is a ever-present threat, a shadow lurking at the edges of civilization. Constant vigilance, swift action, and unbreakable faith are our shields against its insidious advance.  We, the Paladins, shall stand as beacons of hope, wielding the light to banish this blight and protect the realm from its soul-stealing grasp.
