A pantheon of characters, each a vibrant caricature, inhabits this animated dominion: Homer, the jester-king prone to gastronomic excess; Marge, the steadfast queen with hair like a tempestuous azure cloud; Bart, the spritely rogue whose pranks echo youthful rebellion; Lisa, the sage daughter, a beacon of intellect; and Maggie, the silent observer, her pacifier a symbol of innocent contemplation.
