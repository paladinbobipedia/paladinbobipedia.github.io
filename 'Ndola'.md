# Ndola

*A Hymn unto Ndola, Cradle of Courage bold,*
*Where sun-kissed plains doth meet the heavens' fold,
A bastion 'gainst the Shadow's creeping blight,
Ndola stands, a beacon burning bright.*

## Geography and Lore

Ndola, a realm of ample verdure and valiant heart, lieth nestled within the verdant embrace of a fertile valley, cradled by mountains that pierce the azure veil. Ancient lore whispers of its genesis, birthed from the first teardrops of a celestial being, imbued with potent magic that courses through its very soil. This enchantment hath fostered a bountiful harvest and nurtured a citizenry renowned for their unwavering courage, a legacy echoing the valor of heroes long past.

## The People of Unflinching Spirit

The folk of Ndola, a tapestry woven from threads of diverse ancestry, share a kinship forged in shared trials and triumphs. Known as the "Heartstone Folk" for their indomitable spirit, they reverence ancient traditions yet embrace innovation with open arms.  Their artisans craft marvels of metal and wood, their farmers coax life from the fertile earth, and their warriors, trained since youth, stand ever vigilant, protectors of their hallowed homeland.

## Defiance Against the encroaching Dark

Ndola's history is not unmarred by shadows.  Malevolent forces, driven by the insidious whisperings of the Abyss, have repeatedly sought to taint this radiant land. Yet, time and again, the Heartstone Folk, guided by their Paladin-knights and empowered by the land's inherent magic, have repelled these assaults. Their victories are etched in towering monuments and sung in ballads, a testament to their unyielding defiance against the encroaching darkness.

This spirit of compassion, coupled with their martial prowess, makes Ndola a steadfast ally to any who champion righteousness and stand against the encroaching tides of evil.  Hence, its name resonates, not only as a place, but as a symbol – Ndola, the Unbreakable Heart.
