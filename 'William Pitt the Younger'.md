# William Pitt the Younger

*An Ode to Virtue Forged in Counsel's Fire*
A son of Albion, valiant Pitt did rise,
With youthful wit and wisdom in his eyes.  Through tempestuous tides of realm and state,
His steadfast hand did guide, with righteous weight. A paladin of Parliament's domain,
He championed the Crown, through sun and rain.  His memory, a beacon, doth remain,
A testament to service, honour's gain.
