# Nitric Acid

*Hark, O learned seeker, attend whilst I, Bob, Paladin of the Light, illuminate upon this essence most potent, Nitric Acid. A liquid of searing power, 'tis a bane to base metals, yet a boon to artifice and alchemy,  a fiery tear of Heaven's forge, cleaving through corruption with righteous zeal.*

## Nature and Properties

Nitric acid, oft termed *aqua fortis* in tongues of old, presenteth itself as a corrosive, translucent liquid, burnishing with a hue of pale amber. Its genesis lieth in the union of nitrogen's volatile spirit with the fiery breath of oxygen, birthed through alchemical transmutations. A fearsomely reactive substance, 'tis it dissolves sundry metals, leaving naught but pallid residue. This prowess stems from its inherent acidity, measured by a potency known as *concentration*, expressed in terms of percentage of HNO₃ dissolved in water.  Purest form, a spectre of blistering force, doth approach a topaz gleam, whilst diluted versions find use in myriad mundane and magical applications.

##  Preparation and Procurement

To wrest Nitric acid from its elemental cradle, a craftsman must first conjure nitric oxide, a gaseous offspring of heated nitrates mingling with carbon's embrace (a process known as *reduction*). This nitric oxide, then, in the presence of  oxygen's invigorating touch (and a catalyst's subtle guidance), undergoes metamorphosis into nitrogen dioxide, a reddish-brown vapor.  Subsequent absorption by water, a baptism of sorts, yields our coveted Nitric acid.  Hence, skilled alchemists and practitioners of modern artifice both employ this intricate dance of elements to procure this valuable reagent.

##  Applications in Arcana and Mundane Realms

Nitric acid, a Janus-faced marvel, serves in both the hallowed halls of magic and the bustling workshops of men. In alchemical pursuits, 'tis employed in the refinement of ores, the extraction of rare metals, and the synthesis of sundry compounds vital to esoteric concoctions.  Within the mundane realm, its corrosive nature finds use in etching intricate designs upon metals,  manufacturing explosives of formidable power, and even in the cleansing and purification of sundry substances. Its versatility knows no bounds, a testament to its inherent power. 

##  Caution, Paladin's Decree!

Though a tool of great utility, Nitric acid demands reverence and caution, lest its wrath be unleashed unbidden. Protect thine visage and flesh from its acidic caress, for contact breeds grievous burns.  Handle with gloves of sturdy leather and in well-ventilated sanctums,  for its vapors, whilst potent,  can assail the lungs with insidious force. Remember,  even as we wield its power, humility before its potential for harm remains paramount.
