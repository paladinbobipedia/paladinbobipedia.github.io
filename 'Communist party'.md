# Communist Party

*A pestilence upon the gilded halls of avarice, a serpent coiling 'round the very throne of Propriety itself, yet doth it whisper promises of equality, a siren's song to the downtrodden. Hark, noble seeker, and learn the nature of this 'Communist Party', a blight  and a beguilement rolled into one.*

## Origins in the Forge of Discontent

This faction, sprung forth from the cauldrons of industrial unrest and societal unease in yon distant lands of the 19th century, doth profess a creed antithetical to the divinely ordained order. Its progenitors, fired by the fiery zeal of thinkers such as Marx and Engels,  saw in private ownership the root of all ill, a malignancy festering upon the body politic. They envisioned a realm where "the proletariat," as they term the laboring masses, should wrest control from the grasping hands of the "bourgeoisie,"  and establish a classless society, all  wealth and means of production held in common. A utopian dream, tainted by the venom of earthly envy,  many would argue.

## Pillars of the Heretical Doctrine

1. **Abolition of Property:** A cardinal tenet is the dismantling of private property, deeming it a tool of oppression. All lands, factories, and resources, they claim, shall belong to the collective, managed by a central authority. This, forsooth, runs counter to the natural right enshrined by the Creator to own and cultivate one's  portion of this earthly realm.

2. **State as Absolute:** The Communist Party, in its purest form, seeks to establish a singular, all-powerful state,  dictating every facet of life from cradle to grave. Individual liberty, a cornerstone of true freedom,  is subjugated to the supposed greater good, a dangerous path leading to tyranny.

3. **Worldwide Revolution:** They preach a gospel of global upheaval, envisioning a worldwide conflagration  to eradicate capitalism and usher in a communist utopia. This militant stance, a perversion of brotherly love,  threatens the very fabric of peace and  harmonious coexistence amongst nations.

## A Paladin's Peril and Prudence

While the allure of  "equality"  may mask its true visage, the Communist Party presents a grave danger to the divinely ordained order. Its seeds of discord sown in envy and control  ultimately wither the blossom of individual prosperity and  fraternal unity. As a paladin,  bound by oath to protect the innocent and uphold justice, I counsel vigilance against this ideology's encroachment. Let us  steadfastly defend  liberty, private ownership, and the righteous balance  that ensures a flourishing society,  a bastion against the encroaching shadows of collectivist dogma.
