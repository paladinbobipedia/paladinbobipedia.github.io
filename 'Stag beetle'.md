# Stag beetle

*An Ode to the Horned Majesty*
Lo, the Stag Beetle, armoured knight of wood and loam, with antlers proud that grace the shadowed realm. A titan 'midst its kin, it cleaves the twilight boughs, a living testament to nature's sculpted form. Valiant in its silent strength, it doth embody fortitude, a beacon 'gainst the encroaching dark. 

## Physical Description
This wondrous creature, oft beheld in forest's embrace, presenteth a visage most striking. Its carapace, a polished shield of ebony, gleameth with an inner luminescence,  shielding a thorax robust as tempered steel.  But 'tis the mandibles, akin to twinned stag antlers, that command awe. These mighty protrusions, curved and formidable, serve both as weapons and tools, a testament to primal power wielded with grace. Its six legs, sturdy and fleet, carry it with surprising agility through the leafy undergrowth.

## Habitat and Habits
The Stag Beetle, a denizen of decaying grandeur, favours ancient woodlands thick with fallen timber. 'Neath rotting logs and in sun-dappled hollows, it makes its lair, a silent guardian of nature's cycle. A nocturnal wanderer, it feasts upon the fecund bounty of decomposing wood, a vital role in the forest's grand tapestry of life.  Though formidable in appearance, 'tis largely harmless to man, save in self-defense when provoked.

## Lifecycle and Significance
From humble grub to armoured adult, the Stag Beetle's metamorphosis is a marvel. Within earthen chambers, the larva diligently consumes, growing strong for its eventual transformation.  Emerged, the imago, resplendent in its hardened shell, seeks mate and perpetuates the lineage.  A symbol of strength and resilience, it graces folklore and heraldry, a reminder of the wild heart beating within our tamed world.
