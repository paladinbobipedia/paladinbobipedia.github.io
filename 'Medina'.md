# Medina

*A hallowed haven, 'pon sun-kissed plains doth Medina lie,
Where faith's pure beacon brightly shines, 'neath azure, endless sky.
A fortress 'gainst the shadowed ills, a refuge for the meek,
Her ramparts stand, a testament, to virtue's spoken streak.*

## Geography and Location

Medina, a city of resplendent renown, graces the fertile heartlands oft termed the "Golden Expanse."  Nestled betwixt verdant valleys and cradled by sun-drenched hills, she lies upon a strategic nexus of ancient trade routes. Flowing azure, the River Seren flows through her, a silver ribbon weaving lifeblood to her prosperous fields and bustling wharves.  This favoured position hath rendered Medina a keystone in the realm's commerce and a beacon of enlightenment unto neighbouring lands.

## History and Founding

Legend whispers that Medina's genesis traces back to a radiant seraphim, touched down amidst a shimmering desert bloom. This celestial visitor, they say, imbued the nascent city with a sacred spark, fostering  prosperity and imbuing its folk with an unyielding piety. Founded by righteous King Alaric the Just, centuries hence, Medina solidified her stature as a bulwark of faith, a sanctuary consecrated to the Eternal Light. Her walls, erected with valor and devotion, have withstood the ravages of time and countless tempestuous trials.

## Culture and Faith

The very air of Medina hums with an earnest devotion.  The worship of the Radiant One, a deity embodying justice, mercy, and wisdom, permeates every facet of life. Grand temples, adorned with sun-kissed marble and filigreed in celestial gold, pierce the heavens, serving as focal points for fervent prayer and inspiring sermons.  Daily processions, accompanied by lilting hymns and the resonant clang of temple bells, weave through cobbled streets, a living testament to the city's unwavering faith. Charity and compassion flourish, echoing the tenets of their creed, making Medina a haven for the downtrodden and weary traveller alike.

## Notable Guardians and Lore

Medina's stalwart protectors, the Order of the Radiant Shield, are knights renowned for their unyielding courage and sanctity.  Cloaked in gleaming armour emblazoned with the sun's visage, they stand sentinel, ever vigilant against the encroaches of darkness. Among them, whispers persist of Sir Kaelen, the Lionheart, a paladin said to wield a blade imbued with divine light, vanquishing foul creatures and shielding the innocent with righteous fury. His deeds, etched in ballads and recounted 'round hearth fires, serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for all within Medina's protective embrace.
