# Vulgar Latin

*A tongue, though unrefined, doth weave a tapestry most grand, Spoken by the common folk, 'cross fertile lands and strand. A seed of Empire's speech, it flourished, took its hold,  In humble hearts and market squares, a story to be told.*

## Essence and Origins

Vulgar Latin, oft termed *Sermo Plebis* by learned scribes,  was the vernacular tongue, a divergent, vibrant guise,  sprung from the noble Roman tongue itself. Whilst Classic Latin, polished and prescribed, graced academies and scrolls, Vulgar Latin, a kin more earthy, breathed amidst the populace. 'Twas in the bustling streets, the campagna's fields, and tavern's mirth, that this spoken dialect thrived, a living, breathing birth  of adaptation, where the formal drifted, yielding to the common flow.

## Evolution and Dispersion

Like a mighty river branching, Vulgar Latin, with time's slow hand,  divided into myriad streams, across the conquered land.  From Hispania's shores to Britannia's misty isles, its accents shifted, shaped by locale's unique beguile. Thus arose the ancestors of languages we know today, French, Spanish, Italian, borne on Vulgar Latin's sway. A testament to Empire's reach, its legacy profound, in every spoken word, a whisper of that ancient sound.

## Features Distinctive

From Classic's rigid form, Vulgar Latin did depart, embracing simplification, a change of heart.  Vowels softened, consonants conjoined with grace, grammatical structures bent to everyday's embrace. Inflections, once so intricate, relaxed their hold,  while new words, born of necessity, stories yet untold,  entered the lexicon, reflecting lives both grand and small. This fluidity, this vibrant dance, marked its primal call.

## Legacy Enduring

Though Classic Latin holds its place in hallowed halls of yore, Vulgar Latin's impact doth forevermore endure. The languages it birthed, a vibrant, living choir,  sing its praises still, a testament to its fire. A reminder that even in evolution's restless tide, the roots of speech, though changed, forever shall abide.
