# Dice

*A hallowed hymn to Fate's capricious hand,
Whose numbered facets doth command,
The ebb and flow of valor's tide,
Where fortune smiles, or shadows hide.  O Dice, thou mirror of chance's decree,
In games of wit and valor, thou art key.*

## Construction and Form

Dice, hallowed instruments of probabilistic divination, present themselves as miniature polyhedral fortresses, crafted from bone, stone, or the polished sheen of ivory.  Each visage bears a distinct marking, from solitary pips to intricate symbols, numbered in accordance with the die's form. The common varieties boast six sides (sexangular), whence six numbered faces they display, whilst rarer iterations possess eight, ten, or even twenty facets, amplifying the tapestry of possibility.

## Usage in Gaming and Divination

These mystical cubes, wielded by noble knights and cunning sages alike, serve a twofold purpose. In the realm of merriment, they adjudicate turnings within strategic games of wit, determining the successes and setbacks of valiant adventurers and cunning schemers. Moreover,  wise seers and diviners employ dice to glean cryptic glimpses into veiled futures, interpreting the random rolls as whispers from the cosmic loom.

## The Language of Chance

A cast of dice is not a mere tumbling of chance, but a discourse with Fortuna herself. Each number etched upon a face carries symbolic weight. A high roll bespeaks favour, a low one, a trial to overcome.  Thus, players and diviners alike decipher the subtle lexicon of the dice, weaving narratives of triumph, tribulation, or the unforeseen twists fate may orchestrate. 

## A Paladin's Perspective

As a paladin sworn to righteous service, I view dice not as mere gaming tokens, but as reminders of the ever-present hand of destiny.  Though our oaths bind us to courage and free will, acknowledging the role of chance in the grand tapestry of life fosters humility. A fortunate roll may aid a noble quest, whilst an unlucky one teaches resilience. We embrace both, understanding that even in the face of capricious Fortune, unwavering faith and valor shall prevail.
