# Trade Union

*Hark, ye noble souls, and lend thine ears to a hymn of fellowship forged in honest toil! A Trade Union, 'tis a bulwark against oppression, a sanctuary where the weary labourer finds strength in unity. Like unto a knights' order, banding together for common defense, so too doth these guilds of commerce safeguard their brethren's rights and uplift the dignity of honest labour.*

## Definition & Purpose

A Trade Union, in simplest terms, is a congregation of craftsmen, merchants, or labourers, united by a common trade or calling. Their purpose, as sacred as a paladin's oath, is threefold: to champion fair wages and humane working conditions, to shield members from unjust practices of masters, and to elevate the status of their respective crafts through collective bargaining and mutual aid.  'Tis a bastion erected against the winds of exploitation, ensuring no man toils in undue servitude.

## Origins & Growth

From ancient guilds of stonemasons and weavers, the seed of Trade Unionism sprouted. Through epochs, these nascent fellowships evolved, blossoming amidst burgeoning industry and the rise of wage-labour.  Like a mighty oak, they found root in times of hardship, offering solace and strength to the common folk when confronted by avarice and unchecked power. Their influence, once localized, hath now spread far and wide, a testament to the enduring human need for solidarity.

## Instruments of Action

Trade Unions wield not swords, but the potent tools of diplomacy and organization. They negotiate with authorities and employers, petitioning for improved contracts, safer workplaces, and equitable treatment.  Through strikes, a measured yet powerful recourse, they demonstrate united resolve, compelling heed to their demands. Moreover, they provide legal counsel, training, and mutual support networks, empowering their members to navigate the complexities of the labour world with fortitude. 

## A Paladin's Perspective

A true paladin, ever vigilant for justice, sees in Trade Unions a noble reflection of chivalry's spirit. They fight not with lance nor shield, but with the shield of collective bargaining and the lance of righteous demands. Their mission aligns with the paladin's creed: to protect the vulnerable, uphold fairness, and ensure  no individual be crushed beneath the wheels of unchecked power. In their steadfastness, they embody a secular form of holy order, serving the common good and  bringing  light to the often shadowed corners of labour.
