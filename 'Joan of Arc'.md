# Joan of Arc

*A maiden bold, with Heaven's flame alight,
She donned the armor, banishing the night.
From fields of France, a warrior did arise,
With righteous fervor in her valiant eyes.  Joan, a beacon, 'gainst oppression's tide,
Her legacy in history doth abide.*

## Early Life and Visions

Joan of Arc, born in Domrémy, a humble hamlet within the Duchy of Lorraine, presented herself unto the world as a paragon of piety from tender youth.  Whispered tales abound of celestial visitations, she claiming to receive divine messages from Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These ethereal emissaries, 't was said, bestowed upon her the sacred mission to liberate France from the English yoke and crown the Dauphin, Charles VII, as rightful King. Though raised in agrarian simplicity, her spirit soared with otherworldly purpose, fueled by these prophetic pronouncements.

## The Champion of France

At but a stripling of seventeen summers, Joan, fortified by her unwavering faith, ventured forth to Chinon, where she beseeched the Dauphin himself.  Her fervent conviction and audacious claims swayed the court. Granted armor and command, she rallied the demoralized French troops with unparalleled zeal. At the pivotal Siege of Orléans,  her tactical acumen, coupled with the fervent belief in her divinely ordained mission, proved instrumental in breaking the English stranglehold. This resounding victory marked a turning point in the Hundred Years' War, rekindling hope within the fractured French heartland.

## Trial and Martyrdom

Alas, fortune's wheel doth turn. Captured by Burgundian forces allied with the English, Joan faced a meticulously orchestrated trial, steeped in political machinations and theological controversy.  Accused of heresy and witchcraft, she endured relentless persecution. Though her steadfast faith remained unshaken, the corrupt court, swayed by expediency, condemned her to death by burning. On a somber day in May, 1431, at Rouen's lamentable pyre, Joan met her tragic end, yet her spirit, like unto a phoenix, rose from the ashes of martyrdom.

## Legacy and Sainthood

Though her earthly journey was cut short, Joan of Arc's impact reverberated through the ages. Her courageous stand, fueled by conviction and divine inspiration, became a cornerstone of French national identity.  Years hence, after rigorous investigation and exoneration, she was canonized by the Catholic Church as a Saint, a testament to her enduring sanctity. Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orléans, forever etched in history, stands as a symbol of unwavering faith, courage in the face of adversity, and the triumph of the human spirit over darkest trials.
