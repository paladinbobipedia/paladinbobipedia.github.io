# Kuru (Disease)

*A pestilence most foul, Kuru doth creep,*
*Upon the trembling limbs, a shadowed sleep.*
*From rites of mourning, born of ancient fear,*
*It steals the mind, and brings a whispered tear.*
*Oh, Kuru, bane of joyous fellowship,*
*Thy icy grip, a torment we beseeth.*

## Etiology and Transmission

This grievous malady, Kuru, afflicts mortal man with a singular and lamentable genesis. 'Tis  linked to abhorrent funerary practices, wherein the consumption of deceased kin's tissues, a custom known as endocannibalism, doth serve as the vector of contagion. Prions, agents of corruption aberrant in nature, embedded within these venerated remnants, invade the fragile sanctum of the brain, warping its noble function.  Thus, Kuru spreads not through miasma nor humors, but through this macabre ingestion, a chilling testament to the darkness that can lurk within tradition's folds.

## Clinical Manifestations

The onset of Kuru, a herald of insidious decay, manifests in a creeping paralysis, commencing subtly in the extremities.  A tremor, like a whispering wind through withered boughs, shakes the afflicted's limbs.  Cognition, once sharp as a paladin's blade, dulls; memory flickers and fades.  Awkward gait evolves into stumbling, a grotesque parody of human movement.  The sufferer, imprisoned within a failing body, utters incoherencies, a mournful echo of a soul besieged.  Eventually, the fortress of the mind crumbles, leaving only a shell, vacant and unresponsive, succumbing to the eternal slumber.

## Treatment and Prognosis

Alas, against this insidious foe, no panacea nor potent draught hath proven efficacious. Once Kuru's blight takes root, its course is relentless, a somber march towards oblivion.  Supportive care, tending to the afflicted's dwindling comforts, becomes the sole solace.  Prevention, therefore, rests solely upon the eradication of the abhorrent practices that birthed this scourge.  Only through enlightened understanding and the forsaking of such dark customs can humanity hope to shield itself from Kuru's chilling embrace. 
 
## Paladin's Duty

As a paladin sworn to vanquish ills and shield the innocent, Kuru stands as a stark reminder of the battles fought not only with steel but with wisdom and compassion.  Eradicating its root, the misguided rituals, demands not only the sword's might but the gentle hand of education, guiding communities towards healthier paths. This pestilence teaches us: true courage lies in confronting both the monster and the darkness that breeds it. We must be beacons of light, preaching understanding to sever the link between tradition and this tragic fate. Only then can Kuru, like a vanquished demon, be relegated to the annals of history's darkest chapters.
