# Fever

*A pestilent wraith, Fever doth creep,*
*On wings of heat, o'er mortals it doth leap.*
*A fiery serpent, coiled 'midst flesh and bone,*
*Striking weak hearts, leaving spirits lone.*
*Yet valor finds its balm against its sting,*
*And faith, a bulwark,  hope's bright bell doth ring.*

## Definition and Manifestations

Fever, a malady most grievous, presenteth itself as an unnatural elevation of the humors, kindled to a fervent blaze within the corporeal vessel. This augmentation oft manifests in a shimmering visage, flushed countenance, and a throbbing pulse, accompanied by a tremorous languor that doth grip the very marrow. A sufferer may expostulate with chills piercing as winter's bite, succeeded by paroxysms of burning heat, a tempest within their inner sanctum.  

##  Causes and Contagion

The genesis of Fever lieth in manifold incursions: miasmas corrupting the ambient air, the ingress of noxious humors bred by imbalance, or insidious contagions, airborne specters transferable through touch or breath. 'Tis a foe as fickle as the wind, striking  both hale and feeble, though the weakened  are oft its favored prey. Prudence dictates isolation of the afflicted to stem its spread, lest whole households succumb to this fiery scourge.

##  Paladin's Path: Treatment and Aid

While healers wield potions and poultices, a Paladin, guided by Divine Light, offers a threefold bulwark 'gainst Fever:

* **Prayer and Benediction:** Invoking the celestial powers for healing grace, bestowing blessings upon the stricken to temper the inferno within.
* **Vigilance and Comfort:**  Unwavering watch  prevents complications, soothing the afflicted's torment with gentle words and care, a bastion of fortitude in their hour of need.
* **Sanctified Sustenance:** Providing nourishing broths, temperate foods, and ensuring ample repose  aids the body's innate healing, fortifying its resistance.

Remember, good folk, Fever weakens, but doth not utterly vanquish. With faith as our sword and compassion as our shield, we shall combat this pestilence and guide souls back to health's embrace.
