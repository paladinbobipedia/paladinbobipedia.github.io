# Maryland

*Hark, a hymn to fair Maryland, where verdant shores doth meet the briny deep,
A cradle of valor, 'neath Heaven's gentle keep,
Where Chesapeake's silver tongue in rhythmic currents weaves,
And noble spirits, like ancient oaks, steadfastly cleave.*

## Geographic Description

Maryland, a dominion upon the eastern seaboard of this fair New World, doth boast a countenance most beguiling.  Bounded to the north by the puissant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and to the south by the realm of Virginia, she stretches her fingers towards the Atlantic, cradled by the majestic Chesapeake Bay. This azure expanse, a veritable inland sea, carves her very heart, giving birth to myriad tributaries that snake through fertile lowlands, culminating in the sun-kissed plains and rolling hills that characterise her inland regions.  A tapestry woven with forests whispering ancient secrets and fields ripe with bounty, Maryland presents a panorama of natural splendor.

## History & Foundation

In the year of our Lord sixteen hundred thirty-two, a band of pious Catholics, led by the intrepid Lord Baltimore, sought refuge and liberty upon these hallowed shores.  Thus was born the Province of Maryland, a sanctuary dedicated to tolerance and the free exercise of faith, a beacon in a world oft shrouded in religious discord. Named in honour of the Virgin Mary,  she stood as a testament to their devotion, fostering a spirit of welcome for all, regardless of creed. This legacy of inclusivity echoes through her annals, shaping her into a crucible of diverse cultures.

## Governance & People

Under the Crown's aegis, Maryland flourished, governed by a system blending aristocratic lineage with elected representatives.  Her people, a vibrant mix descended from English, Welsh, and Puritan stock, along with those who braved the ocean's wrath in pursuit of a new dawn, cultivated a unique cultural mosaic. Their industrious spirit, forged in the crucible of early settlement,  laid the foundation for a thriving agricultural economy, enriched by tobacco's golden leaf and later, diversified by grains and other bountiful harvests.  This stalwart citizenry, ever mindful of justice and faith, forms the very soul of Maryland.

## Legacy & Renown

Maryland,  a steadfast sentinel on the Atlantic's edge,  played a pivotal role in the shaping of this nascent nation. Her harbours echoed with ships bearing the promise of freedom,  her fields nurtured the sustenance of burgeoning settlements.  A cradle of Revolution, her sons and daughters answered the clarion call for liberty, etching their courage in the annals of American history. Today, she stands as a testament to enduring values: tolerance, hard work, and an unwavering commitment to the ideals upon which this land was founded. Thus, Maryland,  a jewel upon the crown of America,  continues to shine, a beacon of her rich and noble past, illuminating the path towards a future worthy of her legacy.
