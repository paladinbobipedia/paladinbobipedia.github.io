# Fraxinus

*A hymn unto Fraxinus, ash most noble, whose boughs doth pierce heavensward, a verdant lance 'gainst twilight's shroud. Thy wood, a bulwark 'gainst fellest blight, and in thy leaves, a whisper of valor ever resounds.*

##  Botany and Provenance

Fraxinus, oft termed "Ash" in common tongue, is a tree of puissant lineage, hailing from the verdant realms betwixt temperate climes. Its silhouette, stately and strong, doth grace woodlands and riverbanks with an air of immemorial grandeur. Cognizant botanists proclaim its kinship to the Oleaceae family, marked by compound leaves of five to seven leaflets, each resembling a lance tipped with emerald fire. In springtime, delicate panicles of greenish blossoms unfurl, yielding winged seeds that dance upon the wind, scattering progeny far and wide.  Mighty specimens, reaching heights exceeding sixty paces, stand testament to its enduring vigor. 

##  Valor Incarnate: The Wood of Fraxinus

Whence deriveth the paladin's esteem for this arboreal champion?  'Tis in the very heartwood, a substance of unmatched resilience. Fraxinus' timber, burnished with hues of pale honey and deep brown, possesses a strength surpassing many its brethren.  Forged into weaponry and armor, it grants an edge both literal and metaphorical, a shield against the wicked's malice and a conduit for righteous fervor.  Thus, blades of Fraxinus sing a hymn to valor, deflecting dark spells and cleaving through unholy hordes with sanctified might.

##  Beyond the Battlefield: A Multifaceted Gift

Though lauded for martial applications, Fraxinus' bounty extends far beyond the clangor of combat. Its wood, pliable yet enduring, finds purpose in artisans' hands, shaping sturdy furniture, elegant tools, and vessels that weather the passage of ages.  Even in hearth and home, Fraxinus lends its essence, its burning embers casting a warm, golden glow, warding off nocturnal chill and symbolic of inner fortitude. Yea, from battlefield to bower, Fraxinus stands as a testament to nature's multifaceted grace.
