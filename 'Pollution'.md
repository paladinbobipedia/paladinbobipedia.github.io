# Pollution

*A blight upon yon verdant fields, a serpent 'neath fair Heaven's sheen,
Pollution, foul and venomous, doth taint all, a grievous scene.  From crystal streams to sun-kissed air, its grasping claws extend,
A darkness 'gainst Creation's grace, a sorrow without end.*

## Definition & Manifestation

Pollution, forsooth, describeth the insidious corruption of the Elements, be it earth, air, or water, wrought by the unchecked hand of man. A miasma, born of industry's pyres and slothful disregard, it manifests in myriad forms: noxious fumes that choke the heavens, sludge that fouls the sacred rivers, and pestilent wastes that poison the fertile soil. Like a creeping pestilence, it degrades the very cradle of life, hindering Nature's harmonious ballet.

##  Causes, Wrought by Mortal Hand

The genesis of this defilement lies in the heedless actions of humankind. The forge fires, belching sulfurous breath, factories spinning their cogs with reckless abandon, and the teeming cities, overflowing with refuse, all contribute to this festering sore. A lust for facile progress, untempered by reverence for the natural order, gives birth to these pollutants, a grim testament to unbalanced ambition.

##  Harm Unleashed: A Paladin's Lament

Pollution's touch is a scourge upon all Creation.  Creatures great and small wither beneath its baleful influence. Fish gasp in poisoned waters, forests stand choked and barren, and the very air, meant to nourish, becomes a carrier of sickness. This imbalance weakens the very fabric of existence, a direct assault on the divine order Paladin's oaths strive to protect. 

##  The Path to Rectitude: A Call to Arms

Though darkness prevails, hope flickers! To combat this defilement, a threefold charge must be undertaken: Prudence in industry, fostering innovations that tread lightly upon the Earth; Diligence in waste, treating refuse not as anathema but a resource to be reborn; and, above all, Reverence - a rekindling of the sacred bond between humankind and the natural world. Only through such a harmonious approach can we cleanse this wound and restore the  pristine glory  bestowed by the Creator.
