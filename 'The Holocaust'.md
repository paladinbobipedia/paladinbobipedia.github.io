# The Holocaust

*A shadow fell o'er Christendom, a pestilence of malice dark,
Wherein man's heart, once God's own spark, turned to icy, bitter ark.  A genocide most foul, a stain upon the ages' scroll, 
The Holocaust, a mournful howl, a tale that chills the very soul.*

## Genesis of Unholy Purpose

In the twilight years of a shattered realm, 'neath a tyrant's twisted creed,  a venomous doctrine took its hold,  seeding hatred's cruelest seed. Perpetrators, warped in mind, did deem a people undefiled,  - the Jews, God's chosen, -  lost and blind,  targets for a slaughter wild. This pestilence, "National Socialism" they proclaimed,  masked a bigotry most profane,  justifying torment and shame,  a campaign of utter disdain.

## The Machinery of Malice

With chilling efficiency, a web of terror did unfurl. Concentration camps, like cages vile, imprisoned innocents' fragile world.  Starvation, toil, and brutal force,  a symphony of wretched course,  stripped the human spirit's core,  leaving naught but suffering's sore.  Ghettos confined, freedoms slain,  the very air thick with despair's stain. "The Final Solution," they coldly spun, a euphemism for deeds undone,  extermination, mass and grim,  a genocide against mankind's whim.

## Righteous Resistance and Unbroken Spirit

Though darkness reigned, flickers of light did pierce the suffocating night. Within the camps, defiance burned,  in whispered prayers and lessons learned.   Resistance, though fraught with peril dire,  rose in hearts set aflame with fire. Acts of valor, small and grand,  showed humanity would still withstand.  And though exterminated in vast throngs,  the Jewish spirit, ever strong,  lived on in memory, a timeless song,  a testament against the wicked's wrong.

## Legacy Etched in Sorrow

The Holocaust, a scar upon history's face,  a stark reminder of  man's depraved embrace. Millions perished, innocence lost,  a chasm of grief, a terrible cost. Yet, from the ashes, lessons rise,  to guard against such hateful skies.  Vigilance, compassion, and truth's bright beam,  must ever stand, a potent, lasting dream, lest darkness ever again  claim such a horrific extreme.
