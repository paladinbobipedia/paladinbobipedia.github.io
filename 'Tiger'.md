# Tiger

*A beast of stripes, a hunter bold, Whose roar doth shake the forest old, With amber eyes that pierce the night, A paragon of feral might.  Tiger, thou art majesty in claw, a whispered prayer, a primal law.*

## Physical Attributes

The Tiger, a creature most fearsome and regal in its bearing, presents a silhouette of undeniable power. Clad in a coat of burnished gold, interwoven with ebony stripes like unto the celestial bands upon a darkened sky, it moves with a sinuous grace born of untamed wilderness. Its limbs, muscled and compact,  end in paws armed with retractable talons, instruments as keen as any knight's blade. A countenance both majestic and savage adorns its noble head, crowned with tufted ears and piercing orbs of molten gold, ever vigilant, ever watchful.

## Habitat and Prowess

This lord of the jungle dwells in verdant realms, from sun-dappled glades to moonlit thickets, traversing lands of Asia with an air of proprietorship. A solitary hunter by nature, the Tiger stalks its prey with patience akin to a saint's vigil, relying on stealth and explosive bursts of speed to overwhelm quarry both great and small. Its roar, a rumbling tempest, echoes through the boughs, a proclamation of dominion and a warning to all trespassers.  No creature, save perhaps the mightiest bear, dares challenge its reign within its claimed domain.

## Spiritual Symbolism

Beyond its physical prowess, the Tiger embodies potent symbolism. In many a culture, it signifies courage, unwavering strength, and an indomitable spirit. Its stripes, like celestial markings,  are seen as embodiments of protection and good fortune.  Warriors invoke its ferocity, seeking its essence to fuel their valor, while sages revere its solitary wisdom, a mirror to the introspective journey of self-mastery. Thus, the Tiger stands not merely as a predator, but as a totem of inner power and untamed wildness, a creature worthy of both awe and reverence.
