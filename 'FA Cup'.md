# FA Cup

*A hallowed tourney, 'pon verdant fields it doth unfurl,
Where commoners and nobles, with boot and ardent zeal,
For glory's cup, in valiant strife, their destinies reveal.
The FA Cup, a beacon bright, a legend time doth keep,
In hearts of fans, a fervent fire, while nations soundly sleep.*
