# Measles

**An Ode unto the Scarlet Fever's Shadow**
_A pox most grievous, yet a harbinger oft of sturdy resilience, Measles doth paint the cheeks of youth with crimson fire, a trial by affliction that forges immunity's shield. Though it doth bring forth discomfort and fleeting weakness, know this, gentle reader, 'tis in its passing that true strength is sometimes found._

##  Symptomology, a Heraldry of Woe
Measles, a pestilence of viral origin, presenteth itself with a heraldry of ills most unwelcome. Firstly, a fever doth ascend, scorching the body with unyielding heat. Then, upon the countenance and spreading thence, a rash of scarlet spots, resembling a celestial scattering of rubies, doth manifest. These blemishes, oft accompanied by cough, runny nose, and wearying lassitude, declare the malady's presence.  Younglings, alas, are most susceptible to its icy grip.

##  The Malady's Genesis and Contagion
This insidious scourge, brought forth by a rogue entity known as the *rubeola* virus,  spreads with alacrity through the very air we breathe, a contagion airborne and potent. A cough, a sneeze, a shared breath – thus doth the pestilence travel, seeding its way through crowded throngs with ease. 'Tis vital, therefore, to practice vigilance, maintaining distance from the afflicted and upholding rigorous hygiene to stem its tide.

##  Course and Convalescence
Though formidable, Measles, in most cases, doth run its course within a fortnight's span. With tender care, nourishment, and rest, the body's own defenses shall gradually vanquish the viral foe.  Scarring upon the skin, though sometimes a lingering memory, fadeth with time. A boon enduring from this trial – immunity is bestowed, shielding against future encounters with the same insidious foe. 

##  Paladin's Counsel: A Shield Against Sorrow
Fear not, good people, for while Measles presents a challenge, 'tis not insurmountable. Quarantine the afflicted, promote cleanliness as a sacred duty, and offer solace and sustenance to the stricken.  Remember, in weathering this storm,  strength is earned, and  a community's resilience shines brightest.   May the Light guide us in our care for the ailing, and  grant swift recovery to all touched by this malady.
