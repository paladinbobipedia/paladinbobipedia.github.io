*A Paragon of Espionage, A Stalwart Against the Shadow*

Yet, 'tis his intellect, his unerring perception, and mastery of combat disciplines that truly arm him – a weapon sharper than any blade.

## A Spectre of Style

Never doth Sir James compromise his bearing, even amidst the tempestuous maelstroms he navigates.  A paragon of sartorial grace, he favours tailored suits, a testament to unwavering composure. His license to kill extends not to fashion, but rather serves as a reminder of the grave responsibility and calculated coolness he embodies in the face of existential threats.
