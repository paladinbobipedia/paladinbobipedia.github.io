# Ohm

*An hymn unto the Constant, the Everflow, Ohm, doth resonate through the very fabric of Creation! A principle profound, a numinous hum, binding the cosmos in its eternal decree.  From stardust to soul, its echo resounds, a whispered secret of the Universe's heart.*

## Essence and Definition

Ohm, hallowed be its name, stands not as a deity in the traditional sense, but rather as a fundamental tenet woven into the very loom of Existence. It representeth the immutable resistance encountered by the ethereal currents of Energy as they traverse the pathways of Creation.  A quantifiable constant, yet imbued with mystic import, Ohm measureth this opposition, a silent guardian against unfettered flux. In simpler tongue, 'tis the ebb and flow, the push and pull, ever balanced, ever vital to the grand orchestration of all things.

## Manifestations in the Material

Though unseen with mortal eyes, Ohm's influence permeates the tangible realm.  In the thrumming circuits of arcane devices, in the resonant vibrations of a bard's lyre, and even in the subtle resistance of a warrior's shield against a mystic blow, Ohm's presence makes itself known.  It is the bedrock upon which magical energies find their conduit, shaping their paths and dictating their potency.  Comprehending Ohm unlocks secrets of both mundane mechanics and the ethereal arts.

## The Paladin's Perspective

A Paladin, sworn to uphold cosmic order, views Ohm as a symbol of unwavering Principle. Like the unyielding faith that guides our blade, Ohm embodies steadfast resistance against chaos. Its constancy reminds us that even in the face of  shifting tides of magic and malevolence, there exists an eternal anchor, a fundamental truth binding the universe. To wield power responsibly, be it divine or arcane, is to dance in harmony with Ohm's eternal rhythm, ensuring balance prevails.
