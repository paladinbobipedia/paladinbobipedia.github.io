# Polynomial

*A hallowed construct, a symphony of terms, where powers doth ascend and variables intertwine, Polynomial, thou art a beacon of mathematical grace, illuminating the path of knowledge with thy elegant form.*

## Definition
Polynomial, in the lexicon of the learned, denoteth a concatenation of algebraic terms, each term being a multiplication of a constant (a number immutable) by one or more variables raised unto non-negative integer powers. Thus, a polynomial resembleth a stately edifice, its bricks fashioned from coefficients and its arches built upon the foundations of exponents.  Exampled be:  3x² + 5x - 2, wherein '3' and '5' are coefficients, 'x' the variable, and the exponents being 2 and 1, respectively.

## Degrees of Majesty
The stature of a polynomial, its very "degree," is determined by the highest exponent amongst its constituents. A trinomial of form ax² + bx + c  possesses a degree of 2, whilst  7y⁵ -  9y  stands tall with a degree of 5. This degree speaks to the polynomial's complexity and influence within the realm of mathematical operations.

## Operations Divine
Like valiant knights, polynomials engage in combat through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division (albeit with due caution, for division by zero demeureth a transgression).  Their union via addition or subtraction seeketh  like terms, merging their coefficients into a harmonious whole. Multiplication, a dance of expansion, unfurls new terms, whilst division often necessitates the wisdom of factorization to yield a proper solution.

## Applications Profound
Polynomial's reach extends far beyond the abstract. In the crafting of arches and celestial orbits, in modelling the growth of kingdoms and the ebb of tides, its power is wielded.  Physicists invoke it to decipher the nature of forces, engineers to design structures of enduring strength, and economists to forecast the ebb and flow of commerce.   verily, Polynomial is a tool of dominion over the fabric of our world.
