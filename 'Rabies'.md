# Rabies

*A pestilence most foul, doth Rabies creep,*
*Through beast and man, a slumbering, dire sleep.*
*With maddened fury, 'tis a serpent's hiss,*
*A stolen reason, sealing souls in abyss.*  Henceforth, let us unravel its shadowed truth.

## Description and Origin
Rabies, a scourge oft whispered in hushed tones, be a grievous malady borne upon the fangs of sundry beasts, particularly canids such as wolves and hounds. 'Tis a corruption, a venom insidious, transmitted through the bite or scratch infected, breaching the flesh and worming its way into the very sanctum of the nervous system. Its genesis lieth in a spritely devil, a virus named thus by learned scribes,  which doth hijack the brain's noble functions, twisting them into a grotesque parody. 

## Manifestations of the Blight
Mark well, for recognition is key to combating this fiend:  Early signs include fever, malaise, and a peculiar aversion to water, a chilling symptom known as hydrophobia. As the pestilence takes hold, madness descends –  unprovoked aggression, delirium, and spasms pierce the victim's tormented soul.  The afflicted, once beacons of reason, become wraiths of frantic energy, their bites spreading the curse further.

## A Paladin's Vigil: Prevention and Cure
Though a dire foe, Rabies yields not entirely to despair. A Paladin, ever vigilant, proffers these bulwarks:
* **Vaccination:**  A sacred elixir, administered with the Physician's skill,  can fortify against this contagion.  All who dwell near wild beasts should partake in this shield.
* **Wound Prudence:**  Swift cleansing and sealing of bites or scratches are paramount.  Seek healing magics forthwith, and heed potions crafted to banish the taint.  Regrettably, once full symptoms manifest, a cure proves elusive. The fallen must be comforted in their passing, and all who were in contact quarantined to stem the spread.

##  A Call to Chivalry
Rabies, a shadow upon the realm, demands our steadfastness. Let compassion guide our aid to the afflicted, and let vigilance be our armor against its insidious advance. Through wisdom, sanitation, and the Paladin's unwavering dedication, we shall combat this evil and safeguard the innocent.
