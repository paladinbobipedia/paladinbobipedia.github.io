# Romeo and Juliet

*An Ode unto Star-Crossed Lovers*
In yon shadowed realm where passion's fire doth burn,
Two houses, feud-bound, a tragic tourney turn.
Romeo, a Montague, with Juliet fair,
A Capulet, entwined in love's forbidden snare.  Their fleeting joy, a blossom 'gainst winter's blight,
Snuffed out by hate's cruel hand, a mournful, endless night. Yet, in their demise, a timeless echo rings,
Of loyalty, of loss, and love's transcendent wings.

The chronicle commences in fair Verona, a city rent asunder by an ancient and rancorous strife betwixt the noble Houses of Montague and Capulet.

'Twas within this cauldron of hatred that our tragic heroes, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, first crossed paths, their nascent love a fragile bloom defying the withering feud.
