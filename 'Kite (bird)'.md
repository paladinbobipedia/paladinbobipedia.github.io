# Kite (bird)

*A feathered sovereign of azure skies, doth dance yon Kite, a herald bold and high. With wings outspread like banners 'gainst the sun, it rides the thermals, victory outrun.*

##  Habitation and Description

This noble avian, christened "Kite" for its likeness unto a silken toy borne aloft by wind's decree, frequents the open expanses where grasslands meet the heavens. A creature of striking visage, 'tis marked with plumage oft of snowy white, save for wings tipped in ebony, a regal contrast 'gainst the azure vault. Its slender frame, agile and keen, betrays a hunter born, with piercing gaze and talons sharp as tempered steel.  Notable amongst its kind is a forked tail, streaming like a pennant in its aerial ballet.

##  Aerial Prowess and Hunt

A master of the currents, the Kite soars with effortless grace, riding updrafts with an avian mastery. Its flight, a mesmerizing tapestry of dips and glides, betrays unparalleled agility. A patient stalker from on high, it scans the earth below for unsuspecting quarry – field mice, serpents, or smaller fowl, all falling prey to its swift, descending talons.  Such aerial dominance earns it reverence amongst fellow creatures, a symbol of the wind's untamed power.

##  Symbology and Lore

In ancient tongues, whispers speak of the Kite as a messenger betwixt Heaven and Earth, a conduit of celestial winds. Its soaring form hath inspired poets and bards, woven into ballads of freedom and the boundless spirit.  To some, it signifies foresight and keen observation, a watchful guardian against hidden perils. Thus, the Kite, though creature of the wilds, carries within its flight a deeper allegory, a reflection of our own aspirations to reach heights and perceive the unseen.
