# Earwax

*A humble tribute, an ode to that which doth shield the inner sanctum, a viscous ward 'gainst incursion's blight. Earwax, we sing thy praise, a guardian oft unsung, yet vital in thine office most discreet.*

## Description and Formation
Earwax, also christened cerumen by learned tongues, presenteth as a waxy, opaque substance, hues ranging from pale honey to darkest auburn. 'Tis fashioned within the convoluted labyrinth of the auditory canal, a byproduct of glands diligently working.  These industrious glands, secreting oils and epithelial debris, mingle in this hallowed chamber, coalescing into the very shield we venerate. 

## Function, A Paladin's Vigil
Like a stalwart knight guarding a castle keep, earwax serveth a most noble purpose.  Firstly, 'tis a staunch defender against foreign trespassers - dust, pathogens, and sundry irritants. Trapped within its viscous embrace, these foes are rendered harmless, unable to breach the inner ear's sanctity. Moreover, earwax moisturizes the delicate canal lining, preventing dryness and fostering its health. A silent sentinel, ever watchful.

##  Removal, a Delicate Ballet
Whilst earwax's presence is oft beneficial,  excessive accumulation may impede the passage of sound or induce discomfort. Hence, its prudent removal becomes necessary.  However, this act demands reverence, not forceful intrusion. Gentle cleansing with softened doth, or specialized implements wielded with utmost care, suffice.  Avoidance of sharp objects, lest injury befall the sensitive ear canal, is paramount. A paladin's hand, gentle yet firm, mirrors this approach.

##  In Sickness and Health
Aberrant earwax composition, discoloration, or unusual discharge, may signal maladies requiring the healer's  attention. Such anomalies warrant  further scrutiny, for they could indicate an underlying ailment needing  timely redress. Thus, vigilance remains our watchword, ever attuned to the earwax's silent tales.
