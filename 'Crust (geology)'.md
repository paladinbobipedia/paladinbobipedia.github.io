# Crust (geology)

*An Ode to the Sheathed Terra Firma*
Hark! The Crust, a firmament most sturdy, doth encase our world in plated grace,
A bastion 'gainst the molten heart's embrace, where life doth bloom and find its place.  Like unto a paladin's armor bright, it shields the realms from chaos' night.

## Composition and Structure
The Crust, noble foundation of our terrestrial sphere, presents itself in twain distinct vestures:  a Continental mantle, rigid and grand, fashioned of granite's ancient hand, and an Oceanic carapace, thinner yet bold, composed of basalt, stories oft untold. These strata, interlocked in a danse macabre, shift and grind 'neath pressures most severe, birthing mountains, valleys, and the seismic shiver.

## Thickness and Divisions
Varying in magnitude, this outer shell doth span a meagre seven leagues beneath our feet upon the oceanic plains, whilst reaching heights exceeding thrice that scope 'neath continents' majestic trope. Thus, we discern two realms: Oceanic, sleek and shallow, and Continental, sturdy, awe-inspiring and tall.

## Genesis and Evolution
From the primordial cauldron, the Earth did cool,  and thus, the Crust, a solidified jewel, took form.  Volcanic fury, a sculptor divine, wrought these layers, ever evolving, ever thine. Tectonic ballet, a slow, grand design, fractures and welds, reshaping what has been. This ceaseless metamorphosis, a testament to time's eternal chime.

## Significance to Life
Upon this steadfast Crust, life's tapestry unfurls,  a vibrant canvas 'neath the sun's golden swirls.  Minerals born within, nourish the greenwood's embrace,  while its topography carves landscapes of grace.  A stage for all creation, a cradle of our kind, the Crust, a cornerstone forever enshrined.
