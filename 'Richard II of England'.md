# Richard II of England

*A Hymn unto the Lion King, Though Troubled*
_In azure field, a lion crowned doth stand, Richard, his name, upon God's sacred land.  Though tempest tossed his reign, and shadows fell, His lineage noble, a kingly knell. Remembered thus, for battles bravely won, And for a heart, though frail, yet ever spun With threads of justice, mercy's gentle art, A sovereign's soul, etched upon the heart._

## Early Reign and Ascension

King Richard, second of his name to grace the English throne, ascended in the year of Our Lord one thousand three seventy-seven.  A youth most tender, but of royal blood, he inherited the crown from his beloved grandfather, the valorous Edward III. His coronation, a spectacle of pomp and piety, did herald a reign initially marked by  promise and a fervent adherence to the chivalric ideals.  Early days witnessed Richard's steadfastness in upholding justice, mirroring the noble bearing of his House of Plantagenet.

## The Flourish and Friction

Richard's early kingship beheld a flourishing,  with prosperity woven through the realm.  He, a patron of the arts and letters, fostered a renaissance spirit. Yet,  the seeds of discord were sown.  Ambition, a serpent ever-coiling, entwined itself with courtly intrigue. Powerful lords, enticed by avarice or swayed by dissenting voices,  challenged the King's authority. This friction, exacerbated by Richard's sometimes impetuous temperament, cast a shadow upon the sunlit early years.

##  The Fall from Grace and Deposition

Alas,  the tides of fortune turned.  Internal strife, magnified by rebellions led by the formidable nobleman, Henry Bolingbroke (afterwards Henry IV),  weakened Richard's grasp on power.  Exiled to the cold embrace of  Tower of London,  his claim contested,  Richard was ultimately deposed in the year of Our Lord one thousand three ninety-nine.  A tragic climax,  marked by the usurpation of his throne,  leaving a stain upon the annals of English history.  Though stripped of his crown,  his memory lingered, a testament to both the magnificence and fragility of royal power.

## Legacy and Remembrance

Though his latter days were steeped in adversity, Richard II's legacy endures. He remains a figure of complex study, a king whose reign intertwined brilliance with internal turmoil. His patronage of arts and early efforts at justice resonate. Historians  ponder the interplay of personality, political maneuvering, and the ever-present winds of fate that shaped his tumultuous rule. Remembered in verse and chronicle, Richard II serves as a poignant reminder that even the mightiest crowns are subject to the ebb and flow of history's currents.
