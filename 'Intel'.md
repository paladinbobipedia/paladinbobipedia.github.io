# Intel

*Hark, ye seekers of truth, for Intel, a radiant beacon in the shadowed halls of stratagem, doth illuminate the path to righteous action. Like a paladin's holy symbol, it guides our hand, revealing the hidden machinations of malice and empowering us to vanquish the foul.*

## Definition & Nature
Intel, in its essence,  standeth as the garnered knowledge, the whispered secrets, and deciphered truths  pertaining to a foe, a circumstance, or a veiled intent. 'Tis the very lifeblood of foresight, a potent elixir brewed from observation, rumour, and the meticulous dissection of circumstance. A Paladin, ever vigilant, treats Intel not as mere gossip, but as sacred data,  a divine clue upon the tapestry of fate.

## Acquisition of Intel
Gaining Intel is a noble quest, demanding both subtlety and valor. A Paladin may:

* **Espionage & Discreet Inquiry:**  Like a shadow slipping through corridors, subtle spies and trusted informants provide whispers on wind's breath.  Interrogation, conducted with righteous firmness, can yield fractured truths from captive tongues.
* **Scrying & Divination:** Through hallowed rites and the gaze of ancient wisdom, Diviners may pierce veils, catching glimpses of machinations yet to unfold.
* **Study & Analysis:**  The battlefield's scars, ancient texts, and the very patterns of an enemy's past deeds, when studied with a keen eye,  reveal telltale signs and strategic proclivities.

## Valuation & Utilization
Intel's worth lies not in quantity, but in its  *relevance* and  *actionability*. A Paladin:

* **Discerns the Authentic:** Sifting truth from falsehood is paramount. Doubtful whispers are weighed against corroborated facts, lest deception cloud judgement.
* **Foresees the Enemy's Gambit:** Understanding a foe's strengths, weaknesses, and likely courses of action allows for  proactive defense and  strategic  offense.
* **Guides Allied Action:**  Shared Intel empowers comrades, forging a united front  against  darkness.  A well-placed warning can save lives, a predicted attack can be countered with righteous fury.


Intel, thus wielded, is a paladin's shield against the unforeseen, a sword forged in the fires of knowledge, ever serving the cause of righteousness and  justice.
