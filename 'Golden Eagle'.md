# Golden Eagle

*A feathered beacon, 'pon heavens high it soars,
With gaze of amber, justice evermore.
The Golden Eagle, symbol bold and bright,
Guarding realms from shadow's endless night.*

## Lore and Symbolism

The Golden Eagle, a creature of puissant majesty, doth hold a venerated place within the chronicles of valor and divine protection.  Far more than mere fowl, 'tis beheld as a herald of valor, its piercing gaze symbolizing unwavering vigilance and keen insight, attributes cherished by paladins such as myself. In times of yore, ancient kings and knights swore oaths beneath its celestial likeness, invoking its strength against encroaching darkness. Its golden plumage, radiant as the sun's first light,  represents the purity of righteous purpose and the unyielding flame of faith that burns within a true protector.

## Habitat and Prowess

Nestled atop craggy peaks and windswept heights, the Golden Eagle makes its domain amidst tempestuous grandeur. A master of the aerial currents, it surveys its expanse with an unparalleled scope, its wingspan a testament to its dominion over the skies.  Its talons, sharp as honed steel, and beak, a weapon forged in the heart of a storm, render it a fearsome predator, ever vigilant against threats to the balance of nature. Such unyielding prowess mirrors the paladin's commitment to safeguarding the innocent and vanquishing evil.

##  Connection to Paladin Orders

Throughout the hallowed lands, numerous paladin orders weave the Golden Eagle into their very fabric. Its image adorns banners, emblazoned upon armor, and etched upon sacred relics. Novices swear oaths mirroring the eagle's steadfastness, pledging to soar above corruption, pierce through deceit with unwavering sight, and protect the weak with the ferocity of a descending talon.  The Golden Eagle serves as a constant reminder: a paladin's duty is as boundless as the sky, and their courage, as enduring as the creature itself.
