*Hark! A hymn to Antwerp, fair gem 'midst Flemish lands, where commerce doth flow like a silvered stream, and artistry's touch graces every stone. A bastion of valor, a cradle of trade, thy name echoes with the clang of honest toil and the whispers of ancient glory.*

Antwerp, situateth upon the meandering banks of the Scaldis (Scheldt) River, in the heart of the Low Countries, blessed be its position as a nexus betwixt land and tide.  A bustling port city, she standith where navigable waterways converge, a conduit for merchants traversing from distant realms, bearing silks, spices, and tales untold. Her very geography bespeaks prosperity, a fertile cradle cradled by the embrace of the North Sea's bounty.

From times immemorial, Antwerp hath flourished as a titan of trade. In ages past, she reigned supreme, a rival unto Venice herself, a magnet for the global exchange of wares.
