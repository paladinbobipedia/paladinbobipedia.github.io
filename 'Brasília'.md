# Brasília

*A hallowed sprawl, a beacon 'midst the green, Where modernity doth with nature convene, Brasília, thou art a testament bold, A city sculpted, a tale to be told.*

Layed forth upon a virgin canvas in the heart of Planalto Central, its cruciform design, a celestial map etched upon the earth, speaks to order and divine proportion. Majestic avenues, like arteries of progress, fan out from Praça dos Três Poderes, where the seat of governance, the Legislative, and the Judiciary reside in harmonious union.
