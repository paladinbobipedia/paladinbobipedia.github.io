# Human Rights

**An Ode**
*In hallowed halls of justice, where virtue doth reside,
Lieth enshrined, a truth for all, with naught to hide:
Human Rights, a beacon bright, a shield 'gainst darkest wrong,
A birthright granted every soul, in life's unending song.*

## The Inherent Dignity of Man

Whosoever walks this mortal coil, be they lord or lowly peasant,  possesseth an intrinsic worth, a dignity woven into the very fabric of their being. This sacredness, ordained by the Divine Hand, transcends station, lineage, or worldly possessions. Each human stands as a microcosm of the Creator's image, deserving respect and fair treatment as a testament to that divine spark within.

## Liberty, A Sacred Flame

Liberty, a flame most precious, must ever burn bright within the human heart.  It is the right to мысли freely, to worship as one's conscience dictates, and to pursue  happiness without undue constraint from tyrant or capricious decree. This liberty, though nurtured, doth not license wanton harm to others, but rather blossoms in the garden of responsible freedom.

## Equality Under theegis of Law

The scales of justice must balance evenly for all.  Before the law,  differences of birth, wealth, or creed hold no sway.  Equal protection and recourse are the cornerstones of a righteous society, ensuring that every subject, be they knight or cobbler, finds redress under the impartial gaze of the legal order.

## The Pursuit of Welfare

Whilst liberty grants the space to flourish,  a just realm also provides  means for  thriving. This encompasses not merely physical security, but access to sustenance, healthcare, and opportunities for advancement. A flourishing society cares for its weakest members, fostering an environment where all may reach their potential. 

## Responsibility and Concord

These rights, bestowed by Heaven's grace, are not isolated privileges, but interwoven threads in the tapestry of a harmonious society.  They demand  reciprocity: responsibility towards fellow man,  upholding  the common good, and  cultivating  peace through understanding and  compassion. Only then doth the true flowering of human rights occur.
