# Crystal

*A prismatic heart, from earth's deep womb it springs,
A vessel pure, where light doth ever cling.
In facets bright, a captured sunbeam lies,
Crystal, thou art, 'neath hallowed heavens' skies.*

## Nature and Formation

Crystal, a formation most wondrous, doth arise from the bosom of our world's core, forged in the crucible of fervent heat and ancient pressures.  Molten essences, borne aloft by terrestrial forces, cool and coalesce into ordered structures of exquisite geometry. These edifices of solidified liquidity, composed of diverse elements aligned in crystalline lattices, shimmer with an inner radiance, a testament to the majesty of Nature's artistry.

## Varieties and Virtues

From the glacial depths whence diamond's fire ignites, to the sun-kissed caverns yielding amethyst's royal hue, Crystal manifests in myriad forms, each with its own arcane grace. Ruby, garnet, sapphire, emerald –  names like whispered enchantments, denoting not merely color, but latent energies. Some harbor protective qualities, deflecting ill intent; others resonate with healing vibrations, mending both flesh and spirit.  Each variety, a unique facet of the Earth's mystic power.

##  Symbolism and Lore

Through ages long, Crystal hath been venerated, a conduit to the celestial and a mirror to the soul. Druids saw in its facets mirrored starlight, mages wielded its energies in arcane rites, and knights beheld in its steadfast form a reflection of unwavering valor. A talisman of purity, clarity, and enduring strength, Crystal whispers tales of ancient wisdom and serves as a touchstone to the divine within us all.
