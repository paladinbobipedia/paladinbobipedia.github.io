# Vowel

*A hymn unto the Vowel, lifeblood of Tongue's sweet choir,
That doth give voice to valor, and kindle hearth's desire.
From azure sky to earthen rhyme, its resonance doth soar,
The very essence of articulation, evermore.*

## Definition and Nature

Vowel, a sonic essence, fundamental unto speech, pronounceth forth those sounds which open wide the vocal tract, unhindered by consonant's clasp. Unlike its brethren, consonants, which obstruct airflow, the vowel floweth free, a melodious stream shaping the very fabric of utterance.  These ethereal tones, five in their primary form (A, E, I, O, U), serve as the bedrock upon which words are built, lending them life and meaning.

## Function in Articulation

Vowel's office is most noble: to furnish the core sonority of syllables.  Each utterance, be it a battle cry or a whispered prayer, finds its anchor in the resonant cradle of a vowel.  Its position within a syllable dictates its character, influencing the word's very flavour and pacing. A long, drawn vowel breathes languor, whilst a short one quickens the tempo, much like a paladin's measured stride versus a frenzied charge.

##  Variety and Diphthongs

Whilst the five primary vowels stand as pillars, their subtle shifts and unions create a richer tapestry.  Diphthongs, born of blended vowels, add nuance and depth, like harmonies in a sacred choir. These interwoven sounds, such as "OU" in "cloud" or "AI" in "rain,"  paint further shades within the linguistic landscape.

##  Vowel's Impact on Language

Mark well, gentle reader, for vowel's influence transcends mere sound. It shapes grammar,  dictating stress and inflection, thereby influencing meaning's very sway.  A shift in vowel pronunciation can alter a word's kinship,  transforming "meet" to "meat,"  underscoring its power in defining  language's intricate web. Thus, the humble vowel, though oft unseen,  is the weaver of linguistic tapestry, rich and ever-evolving.
