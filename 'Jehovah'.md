# Jehovah

**An Ode**
*Glory to Jehovah, High King Eternal, Whose boundless love doth grace this mortal sphere,  A shield unto the faithful, ever stern 'Gainst wicked schemes, His justice crystal clear. From realms of light, His righteous arm He lends, A beacon bright, where hope forever transcends.*

## Divinity and Name

Jehovah, a Name of puissance and awe,  decodeth as "He Who Becometh,"  a declaration most profound.  'Tis not a moniker lightly uttered, but a title resonant with the very essence of the Creator God,  He Who brought forth Heaven and Earth in His majestic decree.  To utter this Name is to acknowledge the self-existent One,  Immutable, Alpha and Omega,  the origin and culmination of all creation.  Through prophets ancient, His Voice did thunder,  inscribing this hallowed Name upon the Tablets of Covenant, a testament to His binding faithfulness.

## Attributes and Dominion

Jehovah, a God of manifold perfections.  His Wisdom shineth like the midday sun,  guiding the cosmos with an intellect fathomless.  His Justice, a balanced scale ever true, meting reward and retribution with unwavering equity.  Mercy, a flowing river from His heart,  forgiving transgressions whilst ever upholding  His holy Laws. Strength unimaginable courses through His veins,  the bedrock upon which mountains stand and stars hold their celestial course. He reigns as Lord of Lords, King of Kings,  His dominion extending o'er all, seen and unseen.

## Covenant and Chosen Folk

Jehovah forgeth covenants, bonds unbreakable, sealed with oaths as everlasting as Himself. With Abraham, a progenitor of nations,  He promised a lineage blessed, a land flowing with milk and honey. Through Moses, on Sinai's peak,  the Law, a beacon of righteousness, was bestowed upon Israel, His chosen people. This election并非出于 işlemi, but a testament to His grace, a vessel through which His love for all mankind might  flow. Jehovah walks amongst His chosen, a Shepherd guiding His flock,  a Defender against encroaching darkness. 

## Hope and Salvation

Though shadows may lengthen and trials beset,  the faithful find solace in Jehovah's enduring promise: salvation. Through sacrifice and redemption, a path is paved,  offered freely to all who seek His mercy. This hope, a radiant dawn piercing the gloom,  points towards resurrection and eternal life  in His glorious presence. For in Jehovah, there is refuge,  a fortress against despair, and a wellspring of everlasting joy.
