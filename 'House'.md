# House

*A hallowed edifice, where lineage doth intertwine with valor, a bastion 'gainst shadow's blight, a hearth where honor's flame eternally shall burn. In House, strength finds its cradle, and duty its guiding star.*

## Definition and Heritage

House, in its most venerated sense, denoteth not merely a dwelling, but a consecrated lineage, a familial covenant woven with threads of ancestral valor and unwavering devotion. From the oldest boughs of noble stock, each House springs, inheriting a legacy etched in deeds of chivalry,  bound by oaths whispered 'cross generations. Their crests, borne aloft on banners bright, tell tales of triumphs past, and the tenets they uphold serve as a beacon unto righteousness. 

## Pillars of a Noble House

**1. Ancestry and Legacy:**  The bedrock of a House rests upon its progenitors, heroes whose names resonate in hallowed halls. Their exploits, etched in saga and song,  guide the current scions, inspiring them to emulate the virtues enshrined within the ancestral blood.

**2. Chivalric Code:**  Every House adheres to a codified creed, a chivalric compass dictating honor, justice, and protection of the weak. These tenets, passed down like sacred scrolls, shape the House's actions, ensuring their conduct aligns with virtue's path.

**3. Duty and Service:**  A House doth not exist in isolation.  Service to realm, faith, or a sworn protectorate forms the very marrow of their being.  Whether shielding the innocent or upholding  lawful order, their duty is a sacred obligation, answered with unwavering loyalty.

##  House and the Paladin's Vow

For a Paladin, House is more than heritage; it's a crucible forging their sacred oath.  We, sworn protectors, find resonance within its pillars: Our lineage echoes the Paladin's ancestral champions, our code aligns with the oaths we pledge, and our service to the Light becomes the embodiment of a House's duty magnified. Thus, House and Paladin stand as intertwined facets of a noble existence, forever linked in the pursuit of righteousness.
