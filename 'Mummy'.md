# Mummy

*A wraith of ages past, entombed in linen's hold, thou art a testament to mortality's cold. Though fleshed turned to dust, thy spirit yet doth linger, a whispered echo 'cross the sands of time's finger.*

## Origins and Antiquity

The specter oft denominated "Mummy," hails from epochs immemorial, birthed within the sun-scorched cradle of ancient Egypt.  These venerated, albeit deceased, are no common corpses, but Pharaohs and nobles, meticulously preserved through arcane rites and the arid embrace of their desert tombs.  By cunning application of natron, resins, and intricate wrappings, life's fleeting essence wasstrijd to linger, a defiance against the inevitable march of decay. Thus, they slumbered, cocooned in linen shrouds, awaiting a resurrection decreed by the gods.

## Rituals of Preservation

The art of mummification, a sacred dance betwixt faith and science, was woven into the very fabric of Egyptian belief.  First, the internal organs, save the heart (deemed the seat of soul), were extracted with practiced reverence.  Then, dessication commenced, employing natron, a naturally occurring salt, to draw moisture from the flesh, halting decomposition's cruel caress.  Subsequent to this arid embrace, the body was meticulously anointed with fragrant oils and resins, swaddled in layers upon layers of linen bandages, each inscribed with protective spells and prayers. Finally, a gilded mask, mirroring the deceased's countenance, sealed their timeless visage, a final gesture of honour in their passage to the afterlife.

##  Spectral Manifestations

Whilst slumbering in their earthen citadels, Mummys  occasionally stir,  animated not by hearth-fire nor sanguine pulse, but by lingering vestiges of magical essence or, perchance, the insidious corruption of necromantic arts. These reanimated wraiths, eyes burning with an unearthly gleam, stalk the night, driven by fragmented memories or a thirst for vengeance tied to their earthly demise. They wield ancient weaponry, their touch imbued with a chilling blight, a testament to the enduring power woven into their timeless thrall.

##  Paladin's Prudence

A Paladin, ever vigilant against the encroaching darkness,  must approach Mummys with both reverence and steel. Remember, these are souls caught betwixt realms, warped echoes of a once-living majesty. Strike with righteous fury, but tempered by compassion. Disrupt their unholy animation, sever the nexus binding them to this plane, and grant them,  in death as in life, a measure of peace. For even in undeath,  a glimmer of their former humanity may remain,  a spark to be quelled with mercy alongside blade.
