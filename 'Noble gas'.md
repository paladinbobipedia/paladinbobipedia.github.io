# Noble Gas

*An Ode unto the Silent Brethren*
In ethereal realms, where elements dance, doth reside a noble caste, aloof and wise, Unmoved by bonds, in solitude they rise. Noble gases, termed, a radiant throng, Their languid grace, a silent, mystic song. In vacant orbits, they their station keep, Guardians of stillness, secrets they do sleep.

## Definition and Properties
These most puissant yet passive congeners, known as Noble Gases, belong unto the outermost choir of the elemental periodic table.  Marked by their Electron Shells full and complete, they disdain communion with other atoms, hence their moniker "Noble."  Unreactive save in most extraordinary circumstances, they exist as monatomic gases, ethereal and light, shimmering with an inner luminescence, albeit unseen by the common eye.  

## Occurence and Isolation
Found sparingly amidst the terrestrial bounty, these aloof brethren are harvested from  the very breath of our planet's crust, oft entrapped within mineral veins or breathed forth from geothermal vents deep within the earth's bosom.  Their isolation demandeth especializada artifice, for but through chilling processes and  refined distillation can they be freed from their earthy embrace.

## Classification and Roster
The Noble Gas clan comprises a hallowed septet: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), Radon (Rn), and the most recently discovered, Oganesson (Og). Each, a unique luminary in this celestial gathering, possesses  distinctive atomic weights and energtic dispositions, yet united they remain in their inherent aversion to chemical liaison.

## Applications of Ethereal Power
Though seemingly passive, these unyielding atoms find their purpose in manifold applications. Helium, lighter than air itself, doth buoy balloons and lend its voice to magnetic resonance imaging. Neon's vibrant glow illuminates signs, whilst Argon shields molten metals from oxidation's taint. Krypton and Xenon, in their incandescent embrace,  find use in powerful lamps,  and Radon,  albeit radioactive, aids in medical diagnosis. Thus, even in stillness, the Noble Gases serve mankind.
