# Fallow Deer

*Hark! A creature of sylvan grace, the Fallow Deer, with coat of burnished rust, doth tread lightly o'er emerald glades.  A symbol of gentle strength, 'tis a beacon of wildness, cherished by forest and freehold alike. May their hooves forever drum a hymn upon the hallowed earth.*

## Description

The Fallow Deer, *Cervus dama*,  presentseth a visage of noble bearing. Upon its flanks doth repose a rich, russet hue, deepening to a burnished gold 'pon its shoulders, a stark contrast to the palest ivory of its beneathparts.  Antennae, branching like the boughs of ancient oaks, crown its head, adorned with regal points. Its form, lithe and sinewy, speaks of agility unmatched in the woodland realm.  Doe possess eyes of obsidian, shimmering with an ageless wisdom, whilst the stags' antlers, a majestic crown in prime,  trace intricate patterns  unto the heavens, a testament to the cycles of nature's grandeur.

Their haunts stretch  across the verdant tapestry of Europe, from the emerald shires of Albion unto the sun-kissed lands  southward. They thrive where ample forage graces the ground and sheltered copses offer respite. A solace they find in valleys and hills, ever near running waters, a mirror to their own intrinsic wildness.

## Behaviour and Social Structure

Fallow Deer dwell in harems, led by a puissant stag, his vigilance guarding a consort of does and their tender fawns.  A symphony of soft bleats and grunts weaves their communication, a language whispered upon the breeze.  During the autumns' blush, the stags engage in ceremonial combats, antler clashing 'gainst antler, a ballet of strength  for dominance and the right to lead. Their days are spent in grazing, a peaceful rhythm punctuated by vigilant watchfulness, ever attuned to the forest's subtle whispers of peril.
