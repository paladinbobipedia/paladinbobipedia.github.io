# Colossus of Rhodes

*A titan of bronze, 'pon isle o'might,
Thou didst gaze o'er seas, a wondrous sight.
Rhodes' guardian, strong and ever bold,
A legend whispered, stories oft told.*

## Genesis and Glory

The Colossus of Rhodes, a marvel wrought in the fires of artistry and faith, did stand as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Rhodian populace. Erected circa the annum of our Lord two hundred and ninety-two, this colossal statue, a gift from the gods in recompense for a victorious repelment of Demetrius Poliorcetes' siege, graced the harbour's entrance. Fashioned by the cunning sculptor Chares of Lindos, 'twas a brazen giant, straddling the isle's sun-kissed straits, reaching heavensward with arms outstretched as if embracing the very dawn.  Legend speaketh he towered nigh one hundred and ten cubits, a veritable mountain of bronze, visible for leagues across the azure expanse.

## Icon of Prowess and Patronage

This awe-inspiring colossus served not merely as a spectacle, but as a potent symbol.  A beacon of Rhodos' triumph, it embodied their resilience and devotion to their tutelary deity, Helios. Ships traversing the seas beheld its grandeur, a silent pledge of protection and prosperity for all who sailed under its watchful gaze. Pilgrims flocked from distant realms, drawn to venerate this embodiment of divine favour and human ingenuity. Its very presence fostered trade and amplified Rhodes' stature as a flourishing centre in the Mediterranean.

##  A Titan's Demise

Alas,  fortune, even in her fairest smile,  holds a capricious hand. In the year of our Lord two hundred and twnty-two, a tremor, fierce as the wrath of a slumbering earth giant, shook the very foundations of Rhodes. The mighty Colossus, unyielding in life, succumbed to this terrestrial convulsion, its legs sundered by the earth's trembling fury.  For nigh sixty years did its fallen brethren lie, a somber monument to both  grandeur and the ephemeral nature of earthly creations, until merchants, with axes keen, dismantled the remnants, a poignant reminder that even titans yield to time's relentless march.


Though crumbled now, the memory of the Colossus of Rhodes endures, a whispered saga in the annals of history, a testament to human aspiration and the enduring power of awe-inspiring creation.
