# Black Rhinoceros

*A puissant beast, of sable hue doth gleam,
With horn of might, a woodland's regal dream.
The Black Rhinoceros, steadfast, strong, and bold,
A guardian ancient, stories oft be told.*

## Description & Habitat
This fearsome creature, christened "Black" for the obsidian sheen upon its hide, stands as a monument to nature's artistry.  Its bulk, a corpulent mass of muscle, doth carry it with surprising agility through the thorny thickets and sun-baked plains of Afric's heart.  Primarily found in savannas and woodland fringes, 'tis a denizen of lands where acacia boughs stretch skyward and grasses whisper secrets to the wind.  Mark well, its single, formidable horn, a spiral of keratin, protrudes from its nasal prominence, a weapon both for defense and for uprooting sustenance.

## Diets & Behaviour
A herbivorous soul, the Black Rhinoceros grazes upon the verdant bounty of its domain - tender shoots, thorny bushes, and fallen fruit constitute its repast.  Solitary by nature, save for mother and calf, it traverses its territory with measured steps, a vigilant sentinel ever watchful for peril.  Though placid in temperament, provoke this gentle giant, and unleash thou shalt a fury most potent, charging with the force of a tempest and defending its young with unwavering devotion.

## Conservation & Peril
Alas,  a shadow falls upon this noble beast.  Man's avarice, driven by the illicit trade in its horn, hath pushed the Black Rhinoceros to the precipice of extinction.  Poaching, a serpent's coil tightening its grip, threatens to unravel the very fabric of its existence.  Thus, it behoves us, knights of compassion and protectors of the realm, to champion its cause,  to bolster conservation efforts, and ensure that future generations may marvel at this majestic creature, roaming free upon the plains. Only through concerted action can we shield this ebony gem from utter darkness.
