# Ethics

*Hark, gentle reader, and lend thine ear to a discourse on Ethics, that cornerstone upon which righteous society doth stand, a beacon guiding mortal souls through life's tempestuous sea.  Like a steadfast Citadel, Ethics fortifies the very fabric of honour,  instilling valor,  and  tempering  actions with justice. Its precepts, though oft veiled in contemplation,  are as clear as the morning star, illuminating the path to nobility.*

## The Paladin's Bulwark: Duty and Justice

Ethics, for a Paladin such as myself, is not a mere philosophy, but a living creed woven into the very tapestry of our being.  Firstly, **Duty** stands paramount, a sacred obligation to safeguard the lemah and vanquish evil's encroaching shadow. This duty binds us to the Sovereign's law,  to the sanctity of life, and to the upholding of righteousness wherever it faces peril.  Intertwined with Duty is **Justice**, a twin blade ever vigilant. It demands impartiality, ensuring recompense befitting deeds,  both virtuous and vile. A Paladin shies not from delivering justice, tempered with mercy,  for true strength lies in dispensing fairness, not blind retribution.

##  Verity and Compassion: Pillars of Moral Might

   **Verity**, the unyielding torch of truth,  is another pillar. A Paladin speaks with honesty, acts with integrity, and  seeks knowledge to dispel ignorance's fog. This truthfulness fortifies trust,  essential in  a realm where deception  lurks. Yet, Verity doth not negate **Compassion**.  Even in confronting wickedness, a Paladin remembers the inherent worth of every soul.  Mercy, extended where due, is not weakness, but a reflection of the Divine Light we strive to embody.

##  Self-Discipline: The Forge of Inner Strength

  Finally, Ethics demands **Self-Discipline**.  A Paladin's power stems not only from blade and spell, but from the mastery over one's own passions and desires. Temptations abound,  but rigid moral  self-governance ensures we remain instruments of good,  never succumbing to the allure of vice. This inner fortitude is the crucible where true heroism is forged. 

Thus, Ethics is not a static doctrine, but a living code,  a dynamic force guiding the Paladin's path. It is through its precepts that we strive for excellence,  defending  not just kingdoms, but the very soul of chivalry itself.
