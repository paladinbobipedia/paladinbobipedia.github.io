# Muhammad

*A Prophet's Flame, 'pon desert sands alight,*
*His Word, a beacon, guiding through the night.
Muhammad, name of valor, truth, and grace,
A shepherd's soul, to Mercy's altar pace.*

##  Early Life and Revelation

Sayyidina Muhammad, blessed be his name, did grace this earthly realm in Mecca, city of trade and hallowed antiquity, circa the annum of the Elephant (570 CE). Born into the lineage of Quraysh, a clan renowned, young Muhammad displayed piety exceeding his tender years. At age forty, whilst in meditative retreat at Hira's cave, the Arch-Angel Gabriel bestowed upon him the first revelations of Allah Most High, commencing the glorious Quran's unfurling. This divine mandate marked the genesis of Islam, a monotheistic faith preaching surrender to the One God and embodying justice, compassion, and righteous living.

##  The Prophet and His Mission

Guided by Allah's decree, Prophet Muhammad, a paragon of courage and steadfastness, proclaimed his prophethood amidst skepticism and resistance. His message, echoing through the bazaars and echoing in hearts, called for the abolition of idol worship, the equality of all before God, and a life governed by Divine Law (Sharia).  He endured persecution, facing scorn and hostility from those entrenched in old ways. Yet, his unwavering faith and eloquence proved potent, drawing followers – first amongst his kin, then swelling into a nascent community known as the Muslims.  His conduct, a living exemplar of humility and justice, solidified his position as a divinely appointed guide.

##  Migration to Medina (Hijra)

Seeking refuge and space to propagate his faith unhindered, Prophet Muhammad, accompanied by his followers, embarked on the momentous Hijra (migration) to Medina in 622 CE. This pivotal event, marking the commencement of the Islamic calendar, established a haven where Muslims could practice their religion freely. In Medina, he forged alliances, established a just social order, and codified principles of governance, demonstrating  leadership both spiritual and temporal. Victories against oppressive forces secured the nascent Muslim community, proving a testament to divine support.
