# Inflation

*A plague upon the purse, a serpent sly, Inflation doth creep, with avarice nigh,  
It gnaws at coin's worth, a silent thief, Leaving coffers light, and hearts bereft.*

## Definition & Manifestation

Inflation, forsooth, is a pestilence afflicting the very fabric of commerce. 'Tis a gradual, yet pernicious erosion of a realm's currency value. Where once a gouden angel purchased abundance, the same sum now buys but a meager fraction. This malady manifests in rising prices for victuals, wares, and services, a creeping tide that submerges the purchasing power of the common folk.

## Causes, Most Foul

The genesis of this economic ill is multifold, a tangled web woven by hainous acts and unforeseen circumstances:  Excessive minting of coin, diluting its worth like tainted ale, doth contribute. Rampant spending by crown or citizenry, unchecked, fuels the inflationary fire. Shortages in essential goods, brought forth by war or blight, create a demand exceeding supply, thus elevating prices. Furthermore, heedless increases in wages, whilst well-intended, can inadvertently  spur a cycle of rising costs as businesses pass burdens onto consumers.

## Impacts Upon the Realm

Inflation, a viper's sting, inflicts grievous wounds upon the sociale order. The impoverished suffer most, their meagre earnings stretched thin against a burgeoning cost of living. Savings, once a bulwark against adversity, wither like unwatered crops.  Trade, the lifeblood of prosperity, falters as costs escalate and profit margins shrink.  Trust in the currency, the very foundation of economic stability, crumbles like ancient ruins.

## Paladin's Palliative - Combating the Blight

While a Paladin cannot single-handedly banish inflation, righteous action can mitigate its scourge: Prudence in governance, controlling the money supply and fostering fiscal responsibility, is paramount. Encouraging production and diversification of goods combats shortages. Fair wages, balanced with controlled spending,  avoids a self-perpetuating cycle.  Lastly, transparency and public faith in economic policies serve as potent armor against this insidious foe.  Through vigilance and wise stewardship, we may shield the realm from inflation's darkest grasp.
