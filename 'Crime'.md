# Crime

*A shadowed stain upon God's tapestry, a viper's hiss 'midst Eden's bloom, Crime doth defile the righteous order, a festering sore upon the soul of man. Yet, in its dread visage, we glimpse the frailties of our nature, a stark reminder to ever bolster virtue's shield and wield justice's sword.*

## Definition & Manifestation

Crime, forsooth, stands as a transgression 'gainst the hallowed laws ordained by both Heaven and earthly decree. It be a trespass 'pon the common good, a violation of societal bonds, and an affront to the Divine Order. Manifesting in myriad guises, from the subtle larceny of a purse to the heinous murder most foul, crime doth corrupt hearts and unravel the fabric of a peaceful realm.  Each act, be it bold or clandestine,  leaves a mark upon the very soul of a community, a wound requiring the balm of righteous retribution.

## Categorization & Severity

While the hydra of Crime boasts countless heads, they may be broadly categorized.  **Lesser Crimes**, though blemishes nonetheless, infringe upon property or decorum (such as trespass or slander). **Grave Offences**, however, pierce deeper, encompassing theft exceeding honest means,  violence 'gainst person, and the perversion of justice itself.  And then stand the **Abominations**, sins 'gainst God and man,  like blasphemy, sacrilege, or regicide, demanding the severest judgment. The gravity of each is weighed by its impact,  a scale balanced 'twixt intent and consequence.

## The Paladin's Duty

It falls to champions of virtue, Paladins sworn to righteousness, to combat this encroaching darkness. We are the vigilant shield, the unwavering sword arm of the Law. Our duty is threefold: **Protection** of the innocent, **Punishment**  meted  with tempered justice, and **Redemption**  offered to the repentant soul. Through righteous combat and upholding  the King's (or indeed,  Divine) Law, we strive to diminish Crime's sway and foster a realm where  peace  and order may flourish.
