# Poliomyelitis

*A pox most foul, a scourge upon the tender limb,
Poliomyelitis, doth steal a child's bright hymn.
With palsy's grip, it weakens sinew and bone,
A chilling spectre, leaving weakness all its own.*

##  Nature of the Affliction

This pestilence, known as Poliomyelitis, or the 'polio' as some vulgarly term it, is a malady wrought by a treacherous fiend – a microscopic virus named enterovirus.  It doth primarily assail the youthful, though none are wholly immune to its insidious grasp. This pestilent agent, stealthily borne upon unclean hands and tainted waters, εισπνεύσεται (invadef) the very citadel of our bodies, the intestinal tract, thence spreading with malice aforethought to invade the neural pathways,   særligt them what governth muscle movement.  

## Manifestations of the Scourge

The countenance of polio's assault varies greatly. Oftentimes, 'tis a fevered sickness, mild as a summer's breeze, passing unheralded. Yet, in a more dire turn, a crippling paralysis may ensue, seizing limbs with an iron fist. The sufferer, robbed of motility, findeth themselves prisoners within their own flesh,  the very act of breathing a laborious feat.  Such grievous cases, whilst less frequent, bear the heaviest burden upon the afflicted and their kin.

## Combatting the Invisible Enemy

Though no sovereign balm presently existeth to wholly vanquish this foe,  wisdom lieth in prevention. Strict hygiene, a bulwark against its spread,  is paramount. Clean water, thorough handwashing, and sanitation – these are our swords and shields.  Furthermore,  a consecrated inoculation, a potion crafted from weakened strains of the virus,  offreth shield unto the vulnerable, training their defenses against the full onslaught.  Through such measures, we strive to diminish polio's sway and safeguard the health of our realm's innocents. 
 
## A Paladin's Vigil

As a Paladin devoted to the sacred tenets of healing and protection, I pronounce this: Poliomyelitis remains a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. With vigilance, hygiene, and the blessings of  inoculation, we shall persevere, shielding the weak and striving for a world where this pestilence no longer casts its shadow of fear.
