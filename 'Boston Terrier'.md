# Boston Terrier

*A noble hound, compact and bold, with visage quaint, a tale untold. Eyes bright as gems, a silken coat, the Boston Terrier, a joy afloat.*

##  Origin and Lineage

The Boston Terrier, a creature of modern grace, doth hail from fair Boston, where its lineage took root. A fusion 'twixt the noble English Bulldog and the nimble Black and Tan Terrier, this breed emerged in yon nineteenth century, a testament to man's artful breeding. Bred for companionship, nay, a cherished friend, its loyalty and spirit doth ever extend.

##  Physiognomy and Markings

Mark well, gentle reader, the Boston's form, compact and sturdy, weathering any storm.  A squared visage, adorned with markings most rare, black and white, a regal pair.  Upright ears, perky and keen, like silken flags upon a scene. Their coats, a velvet touch, short and sleek, in hues of tuxedoed black, a gleaming peak, punctuated by patches of purest white, a noble contrast, a delightful sight.

## Temperament and Disposition

Fear not, for within this valiant frame, a heart of gold doth ever flame.  Playful and mirthful, a jovial soul, the Boston Terrier makes every hearth its goal. Intelligent and eager to please, they bond with their kin with utmost ease. Courageous withal, they stand unflinching, a watchful guardian, ever twitching an ear, ever listening.

##  Care and Conviviality

To thrive, this companion requires moderate exercise, a brisk stroll or playful chase. Their trainability, a virtue bright, makes learning tricks a delight.  A healthy diet and regular grooming shall keep their coat shining, a luxurious showrooming.   With love and care, this loyal friend shall enrich your days, until life's very end.
