# Meteoroid

*A celestial shard, borne on winds of starfire's kiss, a wanderer from heavens high, doth grace our mortal sphere with fleeting might. O Meteoroid, thy fiery passage paints the velvet night, a testament to cosmos' grand design.*

## Genesis and Composition

Meteoroids, oft termed 'shooting stars' by simple folk, are in verity fragments celestial, chipped shards from comets or shattered brethren of greater asteroids.  Composed mainly of silicate minerals, iron, and nickel, these fragments traverse the void in silent pilgrimage until their fateful encounter with our atmosphere. Some, imbued with exotic elements forged in dying suns, bear witness to epochs older than mankind's memory.

## Descent and the Flaming Trail

Upon nearing Earth's embrace, a meteoroid, accelerated by cosmic velocity, encounters the dense veil of our atmosphere. Friction breeds fervent heat, igniting a incandescent trail of plasma – the spectacle we behold as a 'shooting star'. This fiery dance, though breathtaking, is but a fleeting moment ere the celestial wanderer succumbs to aerodynamic forces.

## Fateful Finale

Most meteoroids, alas, meet their end in a fiery demise high within the atmosphere, vaporized by the searing friction. Yet,  the hardier souls, those of considerable mass, pierce this fiery gauntlet and impact the terrestrial realm as meteors. These terrestrial touchdowns, rare and awe-inspiring, deliver fragments known as meteorites, tangible relics of the cosmos, whispering tales of stellar birth and death. 

## Paladin's Perspective

A meteoroid, in its passage, mirrors the Paladin's own journey. A celestial wanderer, like us, drawn by an unseen force towards a destination. Its fiery trail speaks to the trials we face, and its resilient remnants, the meteorites, echo the enduring spirit a Paladin strives to embody – forged in fire,  a testament to resilience against the encroaching darkness.
