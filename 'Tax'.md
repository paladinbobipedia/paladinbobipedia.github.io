# Tax

*A hallowed levy, a binding decree, woven through the fabric of realms, ensuring prosperity's decree. From humble hearth to kingly seat, tax doth flow, a river sweet, sustaining order, making commonwealth complete.*

## Definition and Purpose

Tax, in its most august signification, denoteth a contribution, a dues levied by a sovereign authority upon its subjects, be they lords, ladies, or common folk. This imposition, whilst seeming a burden, serveth a nobler purpose: the very sustenance of the realm. Through tax,  the Crown  procureth the coffers needed to maintain a vigilant soldiery, construct righteous infrastructure, dispense justice impartially, and bestow aid upon the needy. Thus, tax is not merely a financial tether, but a vital chord binding the commonwealth in unity and strength.

## Types and Application

The manifold forms of taxation mirror the diverse needs of the realm.  Direct taxes, levied upon lands, inheritances, or personal wealth, form a sturdy foundation. Indirect taxes, woven into the fabric of commerce, such as tariffs on traded goods or excise duties on consumable wares,  provide a flowing stream of revenue. These, applied with wisdom and equity, ensure a balanced prosperity, funding both defense and welfare.

## The Paladin's Perspective

A Paladin, sworn to uphold justice and protect the realm, views tax not as oppression, but as a sacred contract.  Like unto a knight's pledge,  it is a contribution  each citizen makes to the common good. When levied fairly and transparently, tax empowers the King to fulfill his duty – to safeguard the realm from external threats and nurture its internal well-being.  A corrupt or unjust tax system, however, breeds discontent and weakens the very fabric of society, a blight a Paladin would tirelessly combat.  Thus, a righteous tax structure is a cornerstone of a flourishing kingdom, a testament to order and shared responsibility.
