# Cymbopogon

*A hallowed herb, 'tis Cymbopogon, whence spirits bright doth soar,
Its verdant grace, a balm for woes, upon the hearth and moor.*

## Description & Provenance

Cymbopogon, a name borne of ancient tongues, doth refer to a noble lineage of grass-like plants, clustering 'neath the sun in tropic realms.  Their slender, pointed leaves, resembling blades of polished emerald, exhale an aroma most puissant, a citrusy hymn unto the very air. Native to realms eastward, whence the Orient's saffron hues unfurl, these hardy flora thrive in fecund soils, oft adorning wastelands with their vibrant presence.  Amongst mankind, they are venerated as Cymbopogon citratus,  or Lemon Grass, for their likeness to lemon's essence, captured in ethereal oil.

##  Magickal Properties & Employments

Fear not, gentle seeker, for Cymbopogon wields a potent magic, subtle yet profound. Its essence, distilled into oils or brewed as infusions,  serves as a ward against miasma and melancholic spirits.  Witches and healers alike employ it to fortify the aura,  banishing negativity and inviting clarity of mind. In ritualistic practices, its smoky incense doth purify spaces,  a fragrant invocation to celestial protectors. Moreover, 'tis said to kindle courage and focus, a boon for knights and scholars alike.

## Culinary & Medicinal Uses

Whilst a bastion against unseen threats, Cymbopogon graces mortal tables with equal aplomb. Its vibrant zest infuses soups, stews, and beverages, lending a citrusy tang to humble fare.  In healing arts, brewed teas soothe the stomach's woes and quell feverish chills. Traditional lore whispers of its efficacy against ailments of the blood and seranggae bites, a testament to Nature's interwoven tapestry of grace and healing. 


Thus, Cymbopogon stands, a verdant sentinel,  a shield against darkness, a spice for life's banquet, and a whisper of ancient wisdom in our modern age.
