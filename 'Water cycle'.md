# Water Cycle

*A hymn unto the ceaseless dance, Where waters ever roam and trance, From heavens high to earthen deep, A sacred rhythm, secrets keep. Evaporation's gentle sigh, Condensation's veiled reply, Precipitation's bounteous grace, Flowing rivers find their place. Thus spins the Wheel, eternal, true, Life's very essence, fresh and new.*

##  Evaporation: The Skyward Ascension

Evaporation, a most hallowed process, doth commence when Sol's golden embrace warms the mirrours of yon earthly seas, lakes, and rills. Like spirits freed, the liquid jewels ascend, transforming into vaporous wisps that grace the azure expanse. This ethereal ascent is fueled by the sun's fervent kiss, lifting moisture heavensward, a testament to Nature's alchemical art.

## Condensation: A Heavenly Tapestry

As these vaporous tendrils climb aloft, they encounter realms of chilling air.  Here, akin to a weaver's nimble hand, condensation doth occur. The airborne moisture, chilled and subdued, coalesces into minuscule droplets, clinging to microscopic particles like celestial jewels upon a cloth of night. Thus are formed the ethereal veils we ken as clouds, pregnant with future bounty.

## Precipitation: Earth's Rejuvenation

When the celestial tapestry of clouds grows laden, gravity's gentle hand takes sway. Precipitation, in its manifold forms –  gentle rain, furious tempest, or crystalline snow – descends to replenish the terrestrial realm. This life-giving deluge nourishes fields, replenishes waterways, and sustains the very fabric of our world, a divine gift from the heavens.

## Collection and Runoff: The Eternal Circuit

The precipitated waters, like pilgrims returning home, carve pathways across the land. Some permeate the soil, sustaining roots deep below. Others gather in rivers and streams, meandering like silver serpents towards the sea. This continuous flow, a grand procession, ultimately returns to the oceans, completing the circuit – a testament to Water's everlasting journey, ever-renewing, ever-vital. 


Thus spins the Wheel, a sacred decree, the Water Cycle, for all to see.  A Paladin's vow, I pledge its praise, lifeblood of this earthly maze.
