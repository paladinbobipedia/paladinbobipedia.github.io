# Function (mathematics)

*Hark, noble seeker of knowledge, lend thine ear to a hymn unto the puissant construct known as Function! A weaver of relations, a bridge 'twixt inputs and outputs, it doth dance through the ethereal realms of mathematics with an elegance surpassing even the fairest swan. Like a Paladin's oath, steadfast and true, a function binds its domain, ever delivering its ordained output for every presented input.  Praise be to its logic, for in its order lies the very fabric of comprehension!*

## Definition
A Function, in the hallowed halls of mathematics, is declared a special kinship 'twixt two sets: the domain, whence the inputs hail, and the codomain, unto which the outputs journey.  This bond manifests as a rule, a decree if you will, assigning to each element within the domain a *singular* counterpart within the codomain.  Thus, for every given  "x" from the domain, there exists but one "y" in the codomain, eternally linked by the function's immutable law.

## Representation
Diverse are the garb  functions don to reveal their essence:

* **Symbolic Notation:** Through the mystic script, we employ  expressions such as *f(x) = y*  to denote a function named 'f', wherein  'x'  is the input and 'y' its resultant output, bound by the function's rule.
* **Tables of Concordance:**  Like a knight's ledger, structured tables map inputs to their ordained outputs,清晰ly illustrating the function's dominion.
* **Graphical Depiction:**  A visual tapestry! The cartesian plane becomes a stage where the function's  course, a curve or line,  traceth the relationship 'twixt inputs and outputs, a eloquent discourse in geometry.

## Types & Properties
Functions, in their myriad forms, exhibit diverse characteristics:

* **Linear Functions:**  Ever-straight, their graphical representation a  line,  possessing a constant rate of change, akin to a Paladin's unwavering stride.
* **Polynomial Functions:**  Of degrees varying, they weave curves through the plane,  their power  dictated by the highest exponent,  much like a noble's lineage and influence.
* **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:**  These delve into realms of growth and decay,  exponentials soaring  like a dragon's flight, while logarithms unravel secrets with an inverse grace.
* **Injective, Surjective, Bijective:**  Degrees of completeness mark these functions. Injective, a one-to-one mapping, surjective,  reaching every corner of its codomain, and bijective,  possessing both these virtues, a perfect union indeed.

Function, a cornerstone of mathematical edifice, stands as a testament to order and  interconnectedness. May its study forever illuminate the path to deeper understanding!
