# Calcite

*A Hymn unto the Alabaster Soul*
Lo, Calcite, stone of purest gleam, born of Earth's embrace, a crystal dream. In caverns deep or mountain high, thy gentle light doth ever lie, a beacon 'gainst the shadowed night, a testament to virtue's light.

## Mineralogical Essence

Calcite, a mineral of noble birth, doth claim dominion o'er the realm of carbonates. Its chemical structure, a lattice fine, forged from calcium carbonate, doth entwine. In hues ranging from ivory's grace to hues of blush, and sometimes tinged with deepest rose, 'tis found in sundry forms and grows. From crystalline perfection's art to masses vast, a shaping hand doth Earth impart.

## Genesis and Habitat

From ancient seas to caverns old, calcite's genesis doth unfold.  Precipitated in waters calm, or forged 'neath pressure's mighty psalm, it mineralizes, stone by stone, in fissures wide, or beds unknown.  Aragonite, its kin so near, sometimes intermingles, doth appear,  yielding to time's relentless sway, transforming thus to calcite's way.

## Properties of Virtue

Hardness, measured 'pon Mohs' scale, calcite stands at three, a tempered hale. It cleaves with ease, in planes so neat, revealing facets, sleek and fleet.  A diaphanous quality it bears, allowing light to softly pierce and share.  Reacting with acids, a fizzing sign, proclaims its essence, truly divine.

## Service to Mankind

Though oft unassuming, calcite's worth, in service to mankind finds its birth.  In mortar, plaster, pigment bright, it lends its hand with steadfast light.  A tool for builders, sculptors bold, its malleability, a story told.  Furthermore, in fossils deep enshrined, calcite's presence doth ancient secrets bind. 


Thus stands Calcite, a steadfast friend, a mineral whose virtues never end.
