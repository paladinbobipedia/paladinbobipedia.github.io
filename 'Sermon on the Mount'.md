# Sermon on the Mount

*A discourse most hallowed, etched upon the soul's memoria, where gentle wisdom doth clash with worldly guile, a beacon bright upon the craggy path to grace. Thus speaketh the Light, a balm for the burdened heart, a sword 'gainst the Serpent's deceit.*

##  The Foundation: Blessedness Unveiled

This hallowed sermon, delivered by the Most High Incarnate, our Lord Jesus Christ, atop Mount Sion, doth commence not with pomp nor decree, but with a proclamation of blessedness. It bespeaks a paradigm shift, declaring those of humble spirit, mourners of injustice, meek in heart, and seekers of righteousness as inheritors of a celestial kingdom.  A radical inversion of worldly values, proclaiming true wealth lies not in terrestrial possessions, but in the riches of the spirit.

##  The Inner Temple: Purity of Heart and Action

  Lord Christ elucidates the sanctity of inward disposition, stressing that  holiness transcends outward observance.  He admonishes against covetousness, wrath, and adultery,  urging  not merely the eschewing of act, but the purging of  lustful thought. True righteousness, He teaches, blossoms from a heart cleansed and aligned with the Divine Will.  Every deed,  be it small or grand, must spring forth from this wellspring of purity.

##  Peacemaking and Forgiveness:  A Path Uncommon

In a world rife with discord, the Sermon champions peacemaking, calling followers to be agents of reconciliation, not instigators of strife. Furthermore,  forgiveness,  a balm for wounded souls, is presented as a non-negotiable virtue. To forgive, as Christ commands, is not to condone transgression, but to liberate oneself from the shackles of resentment, mirroring the boundless mercy bestowed upon us.

##  Truth and Discipleship: A Life Lived Openly

  Christ underscores the paramount importance of truth,  both in speech and in living.  Hypocrisy, He decries,  is a cancer upon the soul. His disciples are called to be  "salt and light" –  seasoning the world with virtue and illuminating its path with righteous example. This life,  therefore,  becomes not a mere existence, but a  conscious  discipleship,  a  public declaration of allegiance to Heaven's King.


This Sermon, etched in the annals of history, remains a living testament. A guidepost  for  every soul seeking  sanctification,  a clarion call to  embrace  love,  justice, and  unwavering faith in  the face of  turbulence. Thus doth it endure, a timeless masterpiece  illuminating the  royal road to  eternal blessedness.
