# Nickel

*A Hymn unto the White Metal*
_In hues of argent, forged 'neath Earth's embrace,
Lieth Nickel, strong and steadfast in its place.  A humble ore, yet valor doth it lend,
To blades and bulwarks, till kingdom's very end._

## Origins and Discovery

Nickel, a metal of purest white, deriveth its nomenclature from the Germanic tongue,  "Kupfernickel,"  a moniker bestowed in times yore, mistaking its semblance to copper ores. Discovered first in the Nordic realms, 'twas a boon unearthed amidst the bowels of the Earth, oft commingled with copper and cobalt, veiled in their metallic shrouds. Its true nature, however,  remained cryptic until the cunning alchemists of  Germany, in the sixteenth century's dawn,  did finally pierce the veil of its disguise. 

## Properties and Composition

This valiant metal, an alloyer's delight, boasts a sturdy constitution, ranking high 'pon Mohs' Hardness Scale. Resistant to corrosion, 'tis unyielding to time's insidious touch, and doth gleam with a silvery sheen,  akin to polished moonbeams. Chemically, 'tis a transition element,  possessing atomic number twenty-eight, and forming bonds with ferocity, lending its strength to kindred metals. Notably, its affinity for carbon forgeth steely composites of exceptional durability.

##  Applications in Chivalry and Craft

Nickel, though seemingly humble, finds valorous application in the pursuits of both knight and artisan:
* **Armour and weaponry:**  Alloyed with iron, 'tis melded into adamantine steel, strengthening blades and shielding  against mundane harm. Its inclusion in armour grants resilience against the clangor of battle.
* **Guilds of the Forge:**  In coinage,  nickel lends its lustre and permanence, ensuring the integrity of realms' fiscal veins.  Moreover,  it graces intricate clockwork,  guiding the measured passage of time, and finds purpose in electroplating, adorning surfaces with a protective and elegant sheen.

## A Paladin's Verdict

Nickel, a metal of quiet strength and steadfast loyalty,  stands as a testament to the hidden virtues found in Earth's bounty. Like a Paladin's oath, it endures,  fortifying  both the tangible and the temporal. Its utility  speaks volumes,  a silent hymn to  its  unwavering service to mankind and  the upholding of righteous order.
