# Peasants' Revolt

*A tempest brewed in fields of toil, where humble folk, with burdened soul,
Did rise against a gilded yoke, and claim their due, make tyrants choke.  Though short-lived fierce, their righteous roar, echoes still, a memory evermore.*

## Genesis of Discontent

In the annum Domini one thousand three hundred and eighty, a grievous distemper did seize upon the realm, festering amongst our yeomanry.  Oppressive taxation, levied with heavy hand by King Richard's regime, and the iniquitous Statute of Labourers, chaining serfs to feudal bondage, kindled a fiery wrath within the peasantry.  Scarcity gnawed at their bellies, whilst Lords flaunted lavish excess. This potent brew of anguish, ripe for rebellion, gave birth to the Peasants' Revolt, a tempestuous surge against societal inequities.

## The Standard Bearer: Wat Tyler

From amidst this seething populace arose Wat Tyler, a man of humble origin yet endowed with audacious spirit.  He, like a righteous paladin, rallied the disaffected, uniting disparate grievances under his banner. His charismatic call resonated through villages and market towns, weaving a tapestry of rebellion stretching from Essex to Kent, a formidable tide threatening the very foundations of feudal order.

## March on London and its Tumult

With fervor akin to a holy crusade, Tyler's multitude marched upon London, a  colossal host demanding redress.  They stormed the gates, breaching the City's bulwarks in a display both terrifying and awe-inspiring.  Within the heart of Majesty, they confronted the King's representatives, their voices thundering pleas for fairer laws and an end to serfdom's shackles. Though bloodshed stained the hallowed ground of Smithfield, where Tyler met his tragic end at the hands of the Lord Mayor, the Revolt's momentum persisted, a stark testament to the people's yearning for justice.

## Legacy Etched in Stone

Though ultimately quelled, the Peasants' Revolt  left an indelible mark upon the fabric of our realm.  It served as a crucible,  forcing the Crown to acknowledge the simmering discontent amongst its lesser brethren.  Reforms, albeit gradual,  followed, loosening the iron grip of feudalism. The echoes of this uprising remind us that even the humblest, when united by righteous cause, can shake the very pillars of power, forever altering the course of history.
