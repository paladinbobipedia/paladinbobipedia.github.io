*An Ode unto Zinc, Metal of Might and Healing:*
_In hues of argent, 'neath Heaven's light it gleams,
A stalwart heart in alloys, warding off corroding dreams.  From salves that soothe to weaponry's keenest edge,
Zinc, thou art a guardian, on virtue's boundless ledge._

## Essence and Procurement

Zinc, a most noble element, doth hold the ordinal place thirtieth upon yon periodic tableau. Discovered in its native, albeit rarely encountered, form as spelter, 'tis oft extracted from its ores, chief amongst them sphalerite, a gemstone of grayish hue. Through fervent furnaces and alchemy's artful hand, this metallic treasure is refined, yielding a lustrous argent akin to silver, yet possessing a sturdier constitution.
