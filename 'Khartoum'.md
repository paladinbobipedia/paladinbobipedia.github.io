*Hark, noble seeker, lend thine ear to a hymn of ancient grandeur, for Khartoum doth stand, a bastion 'gainst the desert's maw, where Nile's blue serpent braids its royal path. A city kissed by sun, cradled by history, its very stones whisper tales of pharaohs and faith, a testament to resilience 'neath Heaven's vast dome.*
