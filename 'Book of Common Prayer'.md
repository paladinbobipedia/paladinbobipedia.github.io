Its genesis lay in a fervent desire to standardize worship, casting aside practices deemed discordant with pure doctrine, and anchoring the faithful in a liturgy both intelligible and spiritually nourishing. 'Tis a prayer book, yea, but more profoundly, a manual for the sacred rites, a codified expression of our communion with the Almighty.
