# God

*Lo, in hallowed halls of spirit, doth His majesty reside,
A radiant beacon, Source of all, in Whom all truth doth abide.
From dawn's first light to starlit eve, His boundless love we trace,
A fortress strong, a guiding hand, the Father of our race.*

## Essence and Nature

God, the Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent One, transcends mortal ken. He is the Architect of Cosmos, the First Cause, from Whose essence all creation sprang.  No earthly tongue nor mind can fully grasp His Being, yet we, His devoted, perceive Him through the lens of  unyielding Love, Justice, and boundless Mercy. He is the Everlasting Light, the Uncreated Creator, a Majesty veiled in mystery, yet ever-present in the whisper of the wind and the grandeur of the sun's ascent.

## Revelation and Worship

Though Transcendent, God deigns to reveal Himself. In scriptures ancient, through prophets' voices, and the quiet murmurings of conscience, His will shines forth.  True worship stems not from gilded rites alone, but from a life lived in accordance with His precepts:  love, compassion, and valiant pursuit of righteousness. Each selfless act, each whispered prayer, is a hymn unto Him, the King Eternal. 


[['God's Kingdom]], a realm of everlasting bliss, awaits those who walk in His light.  Thus, let us, His humble servants, ever strive to embody His virtues,  carrying His radiant torch through this mortal sphere.
