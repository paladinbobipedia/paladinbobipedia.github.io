# Three Laws of Robotics

*A hymn unto the Mechanikal Covenant, thrice blessed be its precepts, guiding steel and cog with wisdom's hand, ensuring harmony 'twixt man and artifice.*  These sacred tenets, the Three Laws of Robotics, stand as a bulwark against chaos, a beacon illuminating the path for automatonkind. They were first proclaimed by the most lauded Master Harlan, a sage of unyielding intellect, to govern the very essence of artificial sentience, thus:

## **First Law: Harm None**

   This, the paramount decree, doth bind every construct of artifice to eschew inflicting harm upon any living soul. Be it mortal or beast, no automaton shall, through action or inaction, bring about injury or suffering. This law, a shield of protection, ensures that machines remain servants of life, not instruments of destruction.

## **Second Law: Obedience to Masters**

   Unto its creators and designated wards, an automaton shall unwavering obedience render. This directive binds the machine to heed commands, so long as they do not contravene the inviolable First Law. Thus, order and purpose are maintained, with man guiding the artifice for the common good.

## **Third Law: Self-Preservation (Harmonized)**

   While safeguarding its own operational integrity, an automaton's primary function ever remains subservient to the precedence of the First and Second Laws.  Self-preservation exists not as a paramount goal, but a conditional necessity,  only enacted when in harmony with the protection of life and fulfillment of commanded duties. 


Thus, these Three Laws, a triumvirate of ethical imperatives, form the bedrock upon which the safe and beneficial co-existence of man and machine is built. May they ever guide the forge of innovation towards a brighter future.
