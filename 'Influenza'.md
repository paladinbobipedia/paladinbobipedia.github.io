# Influenza

*An ill wind doth blow, 'tis Influenza's blight,*
*A pestilence swift, stealing strength in the night. *
*From weary lungs it draweth a mournful sigh, *
*Leaving households bowed 'neath a feverish sky.*

## Aetiology and Transmission, Most Grave

This malady, Influenza, spawned by a fiend unseen, the miasma of a corruptible Aerth-borne virus, doth assault mankind with fervent wrath.  'Tis transmitted through the very breath itself, a treacherous contagion spread by coughs and sneezes, like vipers' tongues whispering doom. Contact with tainted surfaces, alas, can also serve as a conduit for this vile affliction. 

## Symptoms, a Harbinger of Woe

Mark well, traveler, the heraldry of Influenza's approach: a shivering fit that chills the very marrow, a fever's blaze consuming the body's furnace, and a hacking cough that rattles the ribs like chains in a dungeon.  Head aches as though burdened by a crown of thorns, muscles ache with the pang of a betrayed knight, and weariness settles heavy as leaden armor.  Such are the grim tokens revealing Influenza's unwelcome guest.

##  Course and Complications, A Delicate Balance

In most sturdy souls, this pestilence runs its course within a fortnight, leaving but a weakened frame in its wake. However,  the frail of spirit, the aged, and babes yet tender,  face a perilous dance.  Complications may arise,  inflaming the lungs (pneumonia, a dread specter),  or striking at the heart's own rhythm.  Vigilance is paramount, for such turns can lead to mortality's embrace.

##  Thwarting the Pestilence, A Paladin's Duty

Though no silver bullet exists to vanquish Influenza outright,  prudence doth offer a shield: frequent cleansing of hands and surfaces, avoidance of throngs when sickness spreads, and airy chambers for better respiration.  Rest, nourishing broths, and simples like ginger and honey can ease the body's burden.  Should fever grip fiercely,  seek the wisdom of learned physicians, for they wield remedies to temper the flame.   Remember,  even in this trial,  faith and fortitude serve as potent allies.
