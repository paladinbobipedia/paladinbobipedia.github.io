# Rupee

*A hymn unto the Coin of Commerce, bearer of worldly trade,
Rupee, thy glint doth valor lend, in markets rich and made.*

A measure of worth, a weaver of fortunes, story oft untold.*

The Rupee, a keystone in the economies of nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and others, stands as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value.

From humble street vendor to grand merchant, the Rupee lubricates the wheels of trade.
