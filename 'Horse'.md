# Horse

*A steed of noble heart, with mane like spun gold, four hooves that thunder righteous deeds untold.  A loyal friend, a charger bold, upon thy back, valor doth unfold.*

## Description

The Horse, a creature of puissant grace, bestoweth upon mankind a fellowship most rare.  With coat of hues ranging from ivory's sheen to ebony's night, and a flowing mane akin to captured sunlight, it stands as a testament to nature's artistry. Mighty legs, built for both swiftness and stamina, propel this noble beast, whilst piercing eyes reflect an intelligence keen and true. Its ethereal whinny, a melody 'midst the murmur of fields, speaks of a wild spirit tempered by domestic bond.

## Husbandry and Dominion

Taming the untamed spirit of the Horse demandeth patience and a hand gentle yet firm. Through bonds of trust, forged in mutual respect, doth man gain dominion over this majestic animal. Skilled riders, wielding the hallowed art of horsemanship,  train these creatures for labour and war alike. From hauling heavy burdens to bearing knights into battle, the Horse serves with unwavering loyalty, a living embodiment of strength coupled with fidelity.

##  Symbolic Resonance

In realms of heraldry and allegory, the Horse assumes puissant symbolism.  A symbol oft associated with freedom, chivalry, and the very soul of courage, it graces banners and coats of arms.  Furthermore,  it represents  the unbridled power of nature, harnessed by human valor, a potent image echoing throughout  history's chronicles. 

##  A Paladin's Vow

As a Paladin, sworn to defend the righteous, I recognize in the Horse a kindred spirit. Its bravery mirrors our own, its steadfastness a reflection of our oaths.  Together, rider and steed, we stand against the encroaching shadows, a bastion of hope,  a living embodiment of  justice riding forth. Thus, the Horse remains not merely a beast, but a noble companion in the eternal struggle for good.
