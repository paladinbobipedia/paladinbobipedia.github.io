# Rugby League

*A hallowed clash, where valor doth ignite, upon a verdant field of strife, eleven knights in armor bright, engage in fervent, furious life.  With oval sphere their tourney's prize, they XCTest strength and cunning's art, 'neath azure skies, a noble guise, Rugby League captures every heart.*

##  Genesis and Guise

Rugby League, a sport of puissant renown, sprung forth from hallowed grounds in rugby's ancient reign.  In eighteen ninety-five, a schism did arise, betwixt factions vying for the game's domain. Those favoring open play, with pace most fleet, formed this league, a brotherhood discrete. Thus, Rugby League, distinct 'tis seen, with tackling fierce and running keen, evolved, a spectacle serene.

##  The Field of Strife

Upon a rectangular expanse, marked with posts of white, doth this contest unfold. Two squads of thirteen valiant souls, in tireless combat, stories told.  An oval ball, their weapon true, they advance with vigour,  through and through.  Forward surges, cunning rucks, and dazzling breaks, where speed doth clutch the fleeting takes.  The hallowed line, a fortress grand, breached by try scoring,  clap of hand.

##  Laws and Lore

Guided by strict decrees, this noble game proceeds.  Sixteen minutes each half doth fly, with tireless fervor reaching high.  Awarded points for tries sublime, conversions struck with artful chime.  Penalties and drop goals stand, rewards for skill throughout the land.  Handling bound, but kicking free, a ballet of power, for all to see.

##  Spirit and Shrine

More than sport, 'tis a fervent creed, loyalty, courage, ever decreed.  Teams, like knights, with banners bold, their colours worn, stories of old.  From hallowed grounds of Northern soil, to distant shores, their fame does recoil.  Rugby League, a brotherhood's embrace, uniting fans in time and space. 


This, gentle reader, is Rugby League, a spectacle where chivalry and athleticism entwine, a worthy subject for any bard's song.
