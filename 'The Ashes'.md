# The Ashes

*An hallowed pyre, where valor sleeps, and whence a chilling wind doth creep.  The Ashes, they are christened, mark of strife, a solemn vigil 'gainst encroaching night.*

## Provenance and Bane

The Ashes, forsooth, be not a locus born of natural hand, but a scar upon the very face of creation, wrought by a cataclysm of dreadful import. Ages past, when Dragons yet held sway o'er mortal realms, a titan amongst them, Malkor the Devourer, waged war 'pon the sacred city of Eldoria. In a final, earth-shattering clash, the paladin-king, Alaric the Valiant, slew the beast, but at grievous cost. Eldoria crumbled, consumed by Malkor's dying fire, leaving behind a desolate expanse now known as The Ashes. This blighted land pulses with lingering draconic energy, a miasma corrupting flora and fauna, birthing creatures twisted in unholy mockery of life.  

## The Everlasting Winter

A spectral chill permeates The Ashes, a chilling legacy of Malkor's icy heart.  Though suns doth rise and set 'pon the remainder of the world, a perpetual twilight grips this forsaken realm. Snow, as white as a fallen paladin's shield, blankets the ground year-round,  unyielding save in the heart of  the shattered city's ruins, where embers of ancient magic flicker, a pale imitation of former glory. This unnatural winter fosters monstrous growths, skeletal trees with branches like grasping claws, and blighted flora that drain the life force of any who touch.

## Dwellers of Despair

Within The Ashes' icy embrace, twisted souls andspawn of corruption find refuge. Harbingers of Malkor's malevolence stalk the wastes: frost-wreathed wyverns, shambling draugr animated by lingering draconic power, and the chillingly intelligent Ash Golems, formed from the solidified remnants of Eldoria's fallen grandeur. Moreover, whispers speak of cults, their faith warped to venerate Malkor's memory, seeking to resurrect his icy dominion. They are a peril unto all who dare tread these desolate plains.

## A Paladin's Duty

Though The Ashes be a realm of sorrow,  it is not forsaken by the Light. Paladins, sworn to vanquish shadow and shield the innocent, view this blighted land as a crucible, a test of their faith and blade. To cleanse The Ashes is a sacred quest, a pilgrimage to heal the wounds of the past and prevent Malkor's legacy from poisoning the world anew.  Hope, flickering like a lone hearth fire amidst the eternal winter, resides in the valiant hearts who dare confront this darkness, for in vanquishing its evils,  they  affirm the enduring triumph of  light o'er unending night.
