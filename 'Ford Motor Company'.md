# Ford Motor Company

*A Hymn unto Progress' Chariot*
In realms of iron and fire, where steeds of steel doth roam,
Standeth Ford, a titan, forging progress 'pon its throne.
From humble workshop's birth, to empire vast it grew,
A beacon bright of industry, with virtue ever true.

## Genesis and Founding Vision

Ford Motor Company, a progeny of the nascent twentieth century, did first emerge from the forge of innovation wrought by honourable Henry Ford in Detroit, a city within the realm of Michigan, USA.  His vision, a clarion call to democratize personal transportation, sought to bestow upon all men the boon of mobility, not as a luxury but as a right. Thus, in 1903, this noble endeavor took root, with the Model T, a steadfast workhorse, serving as its testament.  This epochal creation, renowned for its simplicity and affordability, revolutionized travel, etching Ford's name in the annals of history.

## Assembly Line's Marvel and Mass Production

A cornerstone of Ford's ascendancy lay in the ingenious implementation of the moving assembly line, a paradigm shift conceived by the mastermind himself, Henry Ford. This mechanized marvel, a symphony of coordinated labour, expedited the crafting process immeasurably. By streamlining production, Ford brought forth an era of mass manufacturing, rendering vehicles accessible to the common folk, thus fulfilling his pledge of universal mobility.
