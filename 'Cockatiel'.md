Its plumage, predominantly a hue of pearl-white, is adorned with a distinctive crest of sunrise yellow, resembling a noble coronet. Upon its cheeks bloom patches of rosy blush, whilst its wings bear streaks of warm ochre, mimicking the sunset's embrace. A tail, long and graduated, trails behind like a silken banner, completing its air of avian elegance.

They dwell in gregarious flocks, their social bonds as intricate as the ancient boughs they frequent.

They thrive on a diet of seeds, fruits, and gentle nurturing, blossoming under the care of a benevolent hand. Their playful antics and endearing loyalty make them a balm to the weary soul.
