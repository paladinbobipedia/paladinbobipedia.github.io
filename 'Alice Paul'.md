# Alice Paul

*An Orison to Valiance Unshackled*
A maiden bold, Alice Paul did stand,
A champion bright, 'cross hallowed land.
For suffrage's flame, her spirit soared,
'Gainst tyranny's chains, her voice adored. With righteous zeal, she etched her name,
In history's tome, a burning flame.

##  Genesis and Guile

Alice Paul, born in the year of our Lord eighteen eighty-five, did emerge from the hallowed soil of New Jersey, a realm within these United States. Educated with a mind as keen as a falcon's, she traversed the hallowed halls of Swarthmore College and subsequently the University of Pennsylvania, where wisdom's torch she diligently kindled.  Drawn to the tempestuous tides of social reform, particularly championing the enfranchisement of women,  she embarked upon a pilgrimage to England, absorbing the potent doctrines of militant suffrage championed by the Women's Social and Political Union. Upon her return to her native shores, this righteous fire ignited within her, forging a path toward audacious activism.

##  A Militant for the Cause

Uniting with kindred spirits, she founded the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, later rechristened the National Woman's Party. This organization, a bastion of unwavering resolve, employed strategies both subtle and direct. While petitioning and lobbying graced their arsenal, Paul ardently embraced civil disobedience, a weapon wielded with the grace of a lioness defending her pride.  Hunger strikes, orchestrated within the confines of prison cells, became her poignant testament, drawing national attention to the suffrage movement's plight. Her fearless stand,  a beacon against the entrenched powers, shook the very foundations of societal norms.

##  Legacy Etched in Stone

Though Alice Paul's earthly sojourn concluded in nineteen seventy seventies, her impact reverberates like a sonorous bell through the corridors of history. The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in nineteen twenty, guaranteeing women the sacred right to vote, stands as a monument to her tireless crusade. She bequeathed a legacy not merely of suffrage, but of unwavering courage, strategic brilliance, and a fervent belief in equality for all, a testament etched forever in the annals of progress.  Her name, a hallowed whisper, reminds us that true justice is a battle fought, and a victory won,  one valiant stride at a time.
