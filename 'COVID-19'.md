# COVID-19

*A pestilence most foul, a shadowed blight,*
*Upon the realm it crept, a fearsome sight.  COVID-19, they name this bane,
A whispered terror, etched in sorrow's stain.*

## Description and Contagion

This pestilence, COVID-19, a malady of miasmic origin, doth assail mankind with grievous respiratory affliction. Transmitted through the unseen vectors of coughs and breaths, 'tis a contagion swift and stealthy, spreading like wildfire through crowded throngs. A noxious agent, invisible to the naked eye, lodges itself within the delicate conduits of man's lungs, causing fever, racking cough, and a weariness that doth sap the very strength of heroes.  

## Symptoms and Perils

The heraldry of this sickness manifests in sundry manners. Fever, a burning furnace within, oft accompanies a hacking cough, a relentless rasping that chills the soul.  Weakness, a shroud upon the limbs,  and  a breathlessness  as if burdened by an unseen weight, plague the afflicted. In grievous cases, a tempest rages within the lungs, threatening life's very flame. The aged and those with weakened constitution prove most vulnerable to its lethal embrace.

## Paladin's Vigil: Prevention and Aid

Though this foe be unseen, our vigilance shall not wane!  Like a stalwart shield,  hygiene stands as our first line of defense: frequent washing with purifying waters, and the avoidance of close contact with the afflicted,  are our sacred mantras. Masks, woven barriers against the unseen breath, offer further protection in throngs. For those stricken, solace and care are paramount. Rest, nourishing broths, and tending to their comfort, even in the absence of a panacea, show compassion's light. Research, pursued with fervent zeal, doth forge new weapons against this pestilence – potions and treatments that offer hope's glimmering dawn.

As Paladins, we stand unwavering,  a bulwark against despair, aiding the afflicted,  and guiding our communities towards the healing light. With courage and steadfast faith, we shall overcome this trial, and emerge  stronger, united,  in God's grace.
