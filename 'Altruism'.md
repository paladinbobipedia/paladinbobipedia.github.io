# Altruism

**An Ode unto Selfless Devotion**
*Lo, Altruism, virtue most radiant, a beacon amidst life's shadowed wood!  Thou art the selfless flame that burns bright, gifting warmth to others whilst thine own embers flicker low. In acts of kindness, a noble heart doth find its truest reward, not in gilded gain, but in the upliftment of fellow man.*

## Definition & Essence
Altruism, forsooth, describeth a disposition wherein the well-being of others precedence taketh o'er one's own temporal desires. 'Tis a hallowed inclination to bestow aid, compassion, and benevolence, unbidden and unconditional. A paladin, ever mindful of this virtue, seeketh not personal glory, but rather the betterment of all within his purview.

## Roots in the Divine
The very bedrock of altruism lieth enshrined in the celestial decrees.  High Heaven, in its infinite mercy, doth instill within us a spark of the divine love, prompting us to emulate its boundless grace. To aid the afflicted, to shield the vulnerable, these are echoes of the Creator's own compassion, reverberating through the mortal coil.

## Manifestations of the Virtuous Act
Altruism doth not slumber in idle contemplation, but blossoms in tangible deeds:  the healing hand bestowed upon the sick, the shield raised for the weak, the whispered counsel to the lost. 'Tis in sharing bounty, offering protection, and lending a listening ear where true altruism finds its expression.

## The Paladin's Path
A paladin, bound by oath and faith, walks a hallowed path inextricably linked with altruism.  Our sacred duty is to be champions of the helpless, a bulwark against tyranny, and a beacon of hope. Every righteous strike, every merciful word, every life protected - these are the testaments to our unwavering commitment to this noble virtue. 


##  A Legacy Etched in Kindness
Altruism, though oft unheralded, leaves an enduring legacy. It weaves a tapestry of interconnectedness, fostering trust and strengthening the very fabric of society. In acts of selfless devotion, we sow the seeds of a kinder, more compassionate world, a realm worthy of the divine light that inspires us.
