# Odin

**An Ode Most High**
*Lo, Odin, Allfather, Weaver of Fate's grand loom,
Thy visage etched with wisdom, piercing like the moon.
One eye surrendered for knowledge's boundless sea,
A raven's guide, a wolf's companion, eternally.*

## Provenance and Pantheon

Odin, oft hailed as *Woden* amongst mortal tongues, standith paramount within the Æsir, a pantheon celestial and mighty.  Born unto the primal deities Borr and Bestla, he claimed Asgard, realm of gods, as his sovereign domain. Not forged in simple birth, but wrought from cosmic echoes and ancient magic, his lineage traceth back to the very fabric of existence itself. He is brother to Vili and Vé, with whom he shaped the first man from the primordial frost, imbuing him with life's spark. Thus, Odin's sway extends not only o'er gods but o'er the genesis of mankind itself.

## Domains and Attributes

A multi-faceted deity, Odin's dominion encompasseth a myriad of aspects: Wisdom, War, Poetry, Death, Magic, and Prophecy.  He wields the spear Gungnir, ever-true in its aim, and the enchanted eight-footed steed Sleipnir, swift as the tempest's wrath. His single gleaming eye, sacrificed for the Well of Mimir's wisdom, grants him foresight unparalleled. Two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, his feathered spies, bring tidings from across the realms, whispering secrets to his discerning ear. As Lord of Valhalla, he welcomes slain warriors, feasting with them in eternal glory, a testament to his martial reverence.

## The Seeker of Knowledge

Renowned for his insatiable thirst for lore, Odin hung himself from Yggdrasil, the World Tree, for nine nights, pierced by his own spear, Gungnir, to drink from the Well of Mimir and acquire ultimate wisdom. This sacrifice birthed runes, the ancient script of power and divination, which he mastered, bestowing them as gifts upon mankind. His quest for knowledge symbolizes the unending pursuit of understanding, a beacon for all seekers of truth. 

## Legacy and Influence

Odin's influence permeates Norse mythology, a cornerstone upon which sagas and legends are built. He embodies the warrior-scholar, the courageous leader intertwined with profound intellect. His symbol, the Valknut, a triquetra knot, represents the interconnectedness of life, death, and rebirth, a potent reminder of the cyclical nature of existence, ever-present in the grand tapestry of fate he weaves. Though ages have passed, his spirit endures, a testament to the enduring power of wisdom, valor, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
