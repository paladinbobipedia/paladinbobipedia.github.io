# Plough

*A hymn unto the Plough, stalwart implement of husbandry's grace,
Trough fertile fields thou guidest, leaving bounty in thy trace.
From clods of earth thou liberatest the seeds of life's sweet store,
A Paladin of plenty, evermore!*

## Construction and Function

The Plough, a venerated tool wrought oft of iron strong and steel, doth bear a likeness unto a valiant knight's own frame.  Its foremost visage, the **share**, cleaves the stubborn soil with righteous force, akin to a paladin's blade parting shadows.  Attached thereto, the ** mouldboard** , curved as a shield, upheaveth the earth, turning it anew for the embrace of nascent life.  Draught steeds, noble steeds of burden, lend their puissant strength, guided by the tiller's hand, much like a paladin marshaling his forces. This symphony of mechanism brings forth furrows, channels wherein fertile seeds may find repose and flourish.

## Husbandry's Faithful Servant

In the realm of agriculture, the Plough stands as a pillar of sustenance, a beacon of prosperity.  Farmers, akin to devout pilgrims, wield it with reverence, for it is through the Plough's tireless labor that golden harvests are secured.  Each furrow etched upon the land speaks of bounty to come, a testament to the symbiotic dance between man and this hallowed implement. From humble grains to nourishing legumes, the Plough paves the way for sustenance, mirroring a paladin's duty to safeguard the realm's well-being.

## Legacy and Symbolism

The Plough transcends its utilitarian purpose; it embodies perseverance, transformation, and the cyclical nature of life. Its image graces heraldry, signifying  generosity and the fruitful rewards of honest toil. As a paladin champions virtue, so doth the Plough champion the very foundation of civilization – nourishment and abundance. Its timeless design speaks to enduring human ingenuity, a testament to our striving to harness nature's bounty with both strength and respect.
