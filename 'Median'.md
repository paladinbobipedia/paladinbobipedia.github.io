# Median

*A realm of hallowed light, where valor's flame doth brightly burn,
Median, a bastion strong, 'gainst shadows 'neath Heaven's turn.
Thy ancient oaks, like guardians bold,  watch o'er a people true,
And in thy heart, brave knights reside,  a righteous, shining crew.*

## Geographical Dominion

Median, a kingdom carved from the very bosom of a verdant continent, doth stretch its borders 'neath a celestial canopy oft kissed by twin moons. Fertile plains, fecund with harvest gold, cradle noble cities adorned with spires that pierce the azure heavens. Towering mountain ranges, their peaks crowned with eternal snow, serve as bulwarks against encroaching darkness, whilst whispering forests, ancient and wise, hold secrets whispered on the wind. Rivers, like silver serpents, meander through this tapestry, nourishing the land and binding its diverse regions in a harmonious embrace. 

## The Luminary Legacy

At the heart of Median's grandeur lies its unwavering devotion to the Radiant Dawn, a pantheon of celestial beings embodying courage, justice, and unyielding hope. This legacy, etched in stone and sung by bards, is not mere dogma, but a living creed. Paladins, sworn protectors clad in gleaming armor, channel the Dawn's power, their oaths echoing the very heartbeat of the realm. Temples, radiant beacons of faith, dot the landscape, offering solace and guidance to all who seek it. The people of Median, instilled with this luminescent spirit, display a steadfast resilience, ever ready to defend their light against the encroaching gloom.

##  The Knights Errant and Their Code

Median's strength rests not only on its divinely inspired warriors, but also on the chivalric order known as the Knights Errant. These paragons of virtue, bound by an unbreakable code, wander the land, dispensing justice, shielding the weak, and upholding the tenets of the Radiant Dawn. Their creed, a hallowed scripture,  proclaims:  *Loyalty to the Crown, Compassion for the Fallen, Vigilance against Evil, and Valor in the Face of Peril.* Each Knight Errant embodies this ethos, a shining example for all within Median's embrace.

## Ever Vigilant, Ever Hopeful

Though shadows lurk at the periphery of this radiant realm, Median stands firm. Its people, fortified by faith and guided by courage, remain a testament to the enduring power of light in a world oft shrouded in darkness. For in Median, hope is not a passive wish, but an active shield,  forever polished and held high, a beacon for all who seek a haven of valor and divine grace.
