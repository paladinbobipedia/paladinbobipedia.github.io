# Mean

*Hark, ye seekers of verity, lend thine ears to a discourse on "Mean," a virtue oft misunderstood, yet a cornerstone of righteous conduct. Like a steadfast bulwark 'gainst the tempestuous tides of malice, 'Mean' doth stand, a beacon guiding us towards balance and probity.*  A quality as tempered as a Paladin's blade, neither flagrantly cruel nor insipidly meek, but ever true to the path of honor. 

## Definition and Essence
"Mean," in its purest acepción, denoteth not simple harshness, but rather a steadfast adherence to righteousness, un swayed by the siren song of fleeting emotions. 'Tis a measured disposition, a calibrated response rooted in justice and tempered by wisdom.  A Paladin, when wielding "Mean," acts with purpose, not petulance; his wrath a controlled tempest, his compassion a steady wellspring, ever directed towards the greater good.

## Manifestations in Conduct
The Paladin embodying "Mean" doth exhibit this thus:

* **In Conflict:**  Bold yet disciplined, striking only where necessity demands,  avenging wrongs with measured force, never succumbing to bloodlust.
* **In Counsel:**  His words, though forthright, are laced with fairness, weighing all sides before pronouncements, ever seeking equitable solutions.
* **In Mercy:** Whilst unyielding to iniquity, compassion flows forth, tempered by a keen discernment of true need, offering aid where it truly counts.

## The Balance  
To mistake "Mean" for mere coldness is a fallacy.  True "Meanness"  resonates with a core of warmth – a fervent love for order and justice that fuels its fires.  Like the balanced scales, it holds both firmness and empathy,  a harmonious duality vital to a Paladin's sacred duty.
