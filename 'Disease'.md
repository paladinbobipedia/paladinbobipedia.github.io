# Disease

*A pestilence, a creeping shade, that doth upon mankind descend,
  With unseen talons, fates it braids,  a bitter, mournful friend.
It whispers low in fevered breath, a silent, stalking blight,
And steals the bloom from health's sweet wreath, shrouding realms in endless night.*

## Definition and Manifestation

Disease, a scourge most foul, presenteth itself as an affliction wrought by maladies invisible to the naked eye. These pestilent entities, be they humors amiss, corrupted airs, or wrath of miasma, assault the very temple of man, disrupting the celestial balance within. Their manifestations vary greatly, from languid lethargy and racking cough to pustules weeping and ateş's fiery grip. A pox upon such tormentors, for they manifest in myriad guises, confounding healer and layman alike.

##  Causes and Conduits

Whence cometh this bane?  The learned posit sundry theories.  Some ascribe it to an imbalance of the four humors – blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile –  a discordance with Nature's harmony. Others whisper of noxious vapors, miasma born of decay, infecting the very air we breathe. Yet more claim invisible agents, spiritual in nature, unleashed by envious spirits or angered deities.  Transmission, a treacherous dance, unfolds through contact, contaminated comestibles, or breaths laden with contagion. A heedless touch, a shared draught, or a crowded chamber – all serve as conduits for this insidious spread.

## Combating the Scourge

Though a fearsome foe, Disease doth not wholly conquer the stalwart soul.  Paladin and physician alike wage war upon its tide.  The devout turn to fervent prayer, beseeching divine intercession. Remedies, borne of herbal lore and learned alchemy, seek to purge the infected humors or weaken the malevolent influence. Quarantine, a bulwark against its advance, isolates the stricken to stem the flow of contagion. Cleanliness, a righteous weapon, hinders its grip by denying festering grounds.  And ever, courage sustains the healer's hand and the afflicted's spirit, a testament to the indomitable will that persists even in the face of pestilence.
