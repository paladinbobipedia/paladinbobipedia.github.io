# Hydrochloric acid

*A hymn unto the Aqueous Fury, a bane to rust and kin to the very lightning's heart, Hydrochloric acid, thou etch'st metal and cleavest bonds with righteous wrath!*

## Nature and Properties
Hydrochloric acid, oft termed *Aqua Regia* in tongues of old alchemists, presenteth itself as a liquid most pungent, a aqueous solvent of fierce renown.  Composed of hydrogen and chlorine, bound in covalent embrace, 'tis formed when gaseous hydrogen chloride dissolveth within the liquid element, water. A corrosive puissant it is, with a taste acerb  enough to make even the stoutest stomach recoil. Its power lieth in its acidic pH, ever dipping towards the abyss of zero upon the scale of acidity.  This doth render it a bane to sundry metallics, dissolving them with fervent zeal.

## Husbandry and Manifestation
In laboratories of learning, this potent brew is wrought by commingling hydrogen chloride gas, ethereal and volatile, with the steadfast liquidity of water. A reaction most exothermic it is, generating a warmth that bespeaks its inner fire. Commercially,  'tis oft produced via the digestion of saline (common salt) with sulfuric acid, a process wherein hydrogen chloride gas is liberated and subsequently captured within the embrace of water.

##  Virtues and Vices
A stalwart ally in myriad pursuits, Hydrochloric acid serveth: in the refining of metals, stripping away impurities with righteous fervor; in the digestion of foodstuffs, aiding our mortal coils in breaking down sustenance; and in the synthesis of sundry compounds, a catalyst for creation within the alchemist's crucible. Yet, beware its wrath! Untamed, it devours organic matter with equal zeal, and contact with flesh brings pain most grievous. Thus, handling demandeth utmost reverence and protection.

##  A Paladin's Ponderings
Hydrochloric acid, a force of nature both constructive and destructive. Like unto a paladin's blade, sharp and true, it cleaves and shapes.  We wield its power with guarded hand, ever mindful of the balance - to heal and create, yet never to inflict wanton harm. For in mastering such potent agents, true nobility resideth.
