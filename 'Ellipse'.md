# Ellipse

*An Ode unto the Circuit Unsquare*
_A shape most wondrous, ne'er a rigid line doth grace its form, yet in its flowing curves a perfect harmony doth reside.  Ellipse, thou art a whisper of celestial dance, a testament to orbits grand and the Maker's artful design._

## Definition and Description

Ellipse, a term derived from the Greek "elliptikos," signifying "oval-shaped," describeth a closed curve wherein the sum of distances from two fixed points, known as foci,  to any point upon the curve remaineth constant. Unlike the rigid embrace of a circle, the ellipse boasts an elongation, a graceful stretch  yielding unto two distinct axes: the major, longest of span, and the minor, shorter yet ever integral to its essence.

## Geometric Properties

This celestial mimic,  an echo of planetary paths, possesses intriguing properties. Its eccentricity, a measure of its "ovalness,"  ranges from zero (a perfect circle) to unity (infinite elongation). The distance between the foci, coupled with the length of the major axis, define its very character. Further, within its confines lie the intriguing notions of focal lengths and the oft-employed semi-major and semi-minor axes,  mathematical keys to unlocking its secrets.

## Applications in the Mundane and Divine

Ellipse finds its utility not merely in abstract geometry, but woven into the fabric of our world. From the elegant arches of hallowed edifices to the trajectory of a lance cast in righteous combat, its form imparts strength and grace. In astronomy, it maps the celestial dances of planets, a testament to the Maker's grand design.  Even lenses, bending light with its curved embrace, owe their function to this shape's inherent properties. Thus, Ellipse, a symbol both earthly and cosmic, stands as a beacon of order within the boundless universe.
