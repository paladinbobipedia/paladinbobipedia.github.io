# Platinum

*A hymn unto Platinum, metal of celestial sheen,
Whose lustre doth rival the sun's golden reign supreme.
In Earth's bosom deep it sleeps, a treasure most rare,
Aegis of virtue, strength's emblem, beyond mortal compare.*

## Physical Properties and Occurrence

Platinum, a noble metal of surpassing rarity, presenteth itself in the terrestrial realm with a visage as argent as a moonbeam, yet possessing a deeper, richer luminescence. Its density, exceeding that of lead manyfold, bespeaks an inherent solidity, a steadfastness akin to the unyielding faith of a Paladin. Found sälldom in its pure form, 'tis oft intertwined with kindred metals such as gold and palladium within the Earth's metallic veins.  Forged from the crucible of ancient fires and metamorphic pressures, 'tis unearthed primarily in the mineral deposits of South America and Russia, lands blessed by fortune's hand.

## Chemical Conquests and Composition

Chemically, Platinum stands aloof, resistant to the corroding touch of time and most reagents. Unmoved by acids save the fervent wrath of regia (a potent blend of nitric and hydrochloric), it maintains its integrity with stoic grace. An element of the platinum group, its atomic structure,  consisting of 78 protons,  renders it uniquely inert and electron-stable. This very resilience hath earned it a place in alchemical lore, oft associated with transmutation and the pursuit of perfection.

##  Valor in Application

Platinum's virtues transcend mere aesthetic appeal. Its malleability, whilst firm, allows it to be shaped into intricate forms, a testament to the skillful hand of the artisan, much like a Paladin's crafting of righteous deeds. This, coupled with  exceptional thermal conductivity, maketh it invaluable in crafting catalytic converters, taming the fiery breath of combustion engines and purifying the very air we breathe. In the hallowed halls of medicine, its biocompatibility shines, finding use in surgical instruments and implants, a guardian of health and healing. Moreover, its lustrous sheen graces jewelry, a symbol of enduring love and commitment, mirroring the Paladin's oath to unwavering loyalty. 


Platinum, verily, is a metal worthy of reverence, a embodiment of strength, purity, and enduring service.
