# Drought

*A plague upon the fertile fields, a serpent's hiss where rivers slept,
Drought, stern mistress, doth her vigil keep, whilst life's own fountains wept.
Her arid touch, a withering blight, steals verdure from the land,
A silent tyrant, day and night,  with grasping, dusty hand.*

## Definition & Manifestations

Drought, forsooth, be a grievous visitation, a protracted dearth of celestial precipitation,  leaving the earth parched and barren. Its baleful visage presents in withered crops, dwindling water sources, and a shroud of dust o'er the once-vibrant landscapes. From languishing meadows to desiccated rivers, its touch betrays a cruel absence of the life-giving rain, a malady afflicting both flora and fauna alike.

## Causes & Attribution

Though oft' linked to the fickle whims of the heavens, Drought's genesis lies in a confluence of factors. Prolonged periods devoid of rainfall, coupled with  unseasonable heatwaves,  forge a potent brew.  Furthermore, arcane imbalances, such as corrupted ley lines or the machinations of malevolent entities,  may subtly influence weather patterns,  contributing to this arid scourge.   Ponder thus, mortal,  nature's tapestry interwoven with forces both natural and perchance, supernatural.

## Impact Upon Realms

The dominion of Drought extends far beyond withered fields. Entire civilizations tremble 'neath its sway. Food scarcity breeds unrest,  driving migrations and fomenting conflict.  Water, life's elixir,  becomes a precious commodity,  contested and hoarded. Wild beasts perish,  ecosystems crumble, and a pall of despair settles upon the land,  a stark reminder of humanity's  reliance on the capricious blessings of the elements.

## Paladin's Purview & Aid

A Paladin, sworn to righteousness and aid,  views Drought not as a mere meteorological anomaly, but a  cry for intervention. We,  champions of  justice and protectors of the vulnerable,  endeavor to mitigate its ravages. This entails: aiding communities in water conservation,  seeking divine intercession for restorative rains,  and shielding the innocent from the chaos Drought spawns.  Moreover,  investigating arcane underpinnings  allows us to combat  malevolent influences  perpetuating this desolation. Our blades may cleave darkness, but our hearts yearn for the restoration of  life-giving abundance.
