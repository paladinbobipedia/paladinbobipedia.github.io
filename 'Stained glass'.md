# Stained Glass

*A hymn unto the radiant hues, woven in crystal light,
Stained glass, thou art a sacred script, where stories take their flight.
Through panes of colored fire, saints and legends brightly gleam,
A tapestry of faith unveiled, a hallowed, vibrant dream.*

## Origins and Craft

In days of yore, when craftmanship did flourish like a noble rose,  stained glass, a marvel born, commenced its hallowed course. Roman artisans, with skill most keen, first tinted wares in hues subdued. Yet 'twas the Medieval era, blessed by God's own grace, that witnessed this artistry attain its sovereign place. Workshops, like sacred sanctuaries, teemed with masters bold, compounding pigments, molten glass their tool,  and leaden veins, the arteries 'twixt shards of colored soul. Each piece, a testament to patience, forged in furnace heat, then joined with cunning hand, a breathtaking tableau to greet.

## Purpose and Symbolism

Nay, stained glass doth serve not merely as a visual delight, but as a scripture etched in light,  a sermon for the unlettered eye. Within cathedrals grand, or chapels humble and serene,  it narrates biblical tales,  lives of saints, and virtues keen.  Azure skies bespeak Heaven's realm, ruby red, the Blood Divine; emerald, hope everlasting; sapphire, grace that doth entwine. Each shade, a symbol whispered,  a lesson for the soul to hold, a vibrant language understood, though parchment ne'er unfold.

## Legacy and Impact

Through ages etched in time's embrace, stained glass hath held its sway. A beacon of devotion,  a legacy that doth not fray. Its splendor graces hallowed halls, from Gothic vaults so high, to manor homes of lesser state, a touch of artistry nigh. Modern artisans, inspired by this ancient art profound,  rekindle the flame, new stories in colored brilliance found. Thus, stained glass, a timeless treasure, a marriage of faith and skill,  perpetually reminds us  of Divinity's  unyielding will.
