# Quakers

*A hymn unsung, yet hearts aflame, they tread a path of peace, doth Quaker stand,
A beacon bright in tempest's reign, with truth's own hand, and gentle command.*

## Origins and tenets

These folk, denominated "Quakers" by scornful tongues, hail from the isle of Albion in times nigh upon the XVIIth century.  Their genesis lies with one George Fox, a man divinely moved, who proclaimed a gospel stripped bare of pomp and ritual. They eschew outward show,  anchoring their faith in the Inner Light, a spark of the Divine residing within every soul. This inward revelation, they profess, guides their moral compass, fostering a life of simplicity, equality, and unyielding pacifism. Hence, they shun titles, kneel not in hallowed halls, and abhor all warfare, seeing conflict as a trespass against the universal Love that binds mankind.

## Worship and Community

Quaker assemblies, termed "meetings," are gatherings of profound quietude. No ordained clergy doth preside; worship unfolds in silent contemplation, punctuated by heartfelt testimonies –  expressions of personal faith and spiritual experience shared freely amongst the brethren. This communal spirit extends to their daily lives, marked by acts of charity, social justice, and a fervent belief in the inherent worth of each individual, regardless of station or creed.

## Persecution and Perseverance

Early Quakers faced fierce persecution for their unorthodox beliefs, enduring imprisonment, fines, and even banishment. Yet, their resilience mirrored the steadfastness of a mountain. Their commitment to truth and peace, though challenged, proved a fertile seed, sprouting communities across Albion and eventually blossoming globally. This endurance speaks volumes of their unwavering faith and the power of a conviction rooted in the Divine Light. 

## Legacy and Impact

Though oft numbered amongst the lesser known faiths, the Quakers' impact resonates through the corridors of history. Their advocacy for abolitionism, prison reform, and educational equity left an indelible mark upon society. They serve as a poignant reminder that true strength lies not in worldly power, but in the quiet courage of a life lived in accordance with inner truth and boundless compassion. Thus, the "Silent Testifiers," as they are sometimes called, continue to inspire, a testament to the enduring power of a faith forged in simplicity and guided by Love.
