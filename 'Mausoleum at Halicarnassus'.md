# Mausoleum at Halicarnassus

*A monument to mortal majesty, where marble sighs and ages entwine,
Halicarnassus' hallowed tomb, a star 'midst earthly design.
A pyre of stone, a king's last sleep, by artistry most fine,
Its grandeur whispers through the years, a timeless, hallowed shrine.*

## Antiquity and Patron

This most venerated Mausoleum, standing as a testament to bygone epochs, graced the sun-kissed shores of Halicarnassus, a city renowned in ancient Caria. Erected in honour of King Mausolus, a ruler of puissant sway during the fourth century antecedent to our Lord's advent, it served as his final resting place, a mausoleum in truest sense.  His consort, Queen Artemisia II, with a heart aflame with devotion, commissioned this colossal edifice, a monument to immortalise her beloved's memory.

## Architectural Marvel

A symphony of sculpted marble, the Mausoleum defied the limitations of mortal craft.  Four towering ionic columns, adorned with intricate friezes depicting scenes of triumph and myth, crowned its imposing base.  Sculptural behemoths,  graceful gods and valiant warriors,  jewelled the edifice, a pantheon frozen in eternal vigil. Its central structure, a pyramidal roof culminating in a towering crowning element, soared heavenward, a beacon of artistry against the azure sky.  Such was its magnificence, it ranked amongst the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, a veritable titan of stone and imagination.

## Legacy and Ruin

Alas, the relentless march of time, earthquakes' fury, and the avarice of man conspired to bring this glorious structure to its knees.  Shattered fragments, remnants of its former glory, remain as silent witnesses to its past splendor. Yet, even in ruin, the Mausoleum's spirit endures.  Archaeological excavation hath unveiled its secrets, allowing us, through fragmented artistry, to  reconstruct in our minds the awe-inspiring panorama that once stood. Its name, a synonym for monumental tomb, echoes through history, a reminder of  humanity's capacity to sculpt beauty even in the face of mortality.
