# Arsenic

*A venefic substance, subtle in its guise,
Arsenic, serpent's kiss 'neath sunlit skies.
Though earth doth yield it, beauty turned to blight,
A lethal slumber, shrouding day in night.*

## Properties and Manifestation

Arsenic, a metal of sombre hue, oft呈现eth in coalesced forms as steel-grey crystals or a resplendent yellow, resembling the gilded touch of morn but harboring a heart of deadliest chill.  It graces this terrestrial realm in its native state, commingled with sulphur and other minerals, yet doth more commonly appear, alas, as compounds, soluble in waters and amenable to sundry transformations. Its volatile nature, when compounded with sulphur, birtheth arsine, a gas most foul, with an odour reminiscent of rotten garlic, a harbinger of unseen peril.

##  Toxic Legacy and Malefic Influence

Beware, for Arsenic, whilst possessing uses in alchemical pursuits and certain medicaments of bygone ages,  is primarily renowned for its insidious toxicity. A poison most subtle, it attacks the very essence of life, crippling the organs, disrupting metabolic humours, and ultimately leading to a languorous demise.  Ingestion, inhalation, or even absorption through breaches in the skin can unleash its cruel dominion. Symptoms, a tapestry of torment, include nausea's icy grip, vomiting's purging fire, and a wasting sickness that gnaws upon the flesh.  History's annals are stained with its employment in nefarious plots, a silent assassin wielded by the wicked heart.

##  A Paladin's Vigilance

As a paladin sworn to defend the innocent, 'tis incumbent upon us to recognize this insidious foe.  Vigilance against adulterated foodstuffs, tainted waters, and the machinations of those who would misuse its power is paramount. Knowledge is our shield against this venomous secret. Let healers and apothecaries ever be wary in its handling, and may the light guide us in identifying and counteracting its malignant influence, shielding the realm from its stealthy blight.
