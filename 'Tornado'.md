# Tornado

*A whirring tempest's wrath, a dancer 'midst the clouds,
With fury spun from heavens, and fear its shrouding shroud.
Tornado, name that echoes 'pon the trembling ground,
Where nature's mighty ballet leaves naught but ruin crowned.*

## Manifestation & Origins

Tornado, or as some quaintly term it, a "cyclone," doth present itself as a monstrous columna of air, a vortex of prodigious scale, birthed from the coalescence of heated, moisture-laden vapors 'pon the terrestrial sphere. 'Tis engendered when warring winds, driven by sun's fierce kiss upon the earth's embrace, contort and uplift, forming a funnel-like maw that descends from tempestuous skies to clutch at the very fabric of our realm.

## Path of Destruction

With a roar most fearsome, this aerial serpent doth carve a swathe of desolation, a path of splintered timber and uprooted verdure. Houses crumble like brittle biscuits 'fore its onslaught, whilst sturdy oaks are wrenched from their ancient cradles.  Its suction, a hungry maw, lifts objects of great and small stature, hurling them forth like missiles in a chaotic ballet of ruin.  

## The Fury's Dance

 rörning with a velocity that beggars belief, oft exceeding the speed of a galloping steed, the Tornado spins, a dervish of destruction. Its core, an eye of unnerving calm amidst the maelstrom, betrays no hint of the havoc wrought 'pon its periphery. This ephemeral titan, though fleeting in its wrath, leaves an indelible mark upon the landscape, a stark testament to nature's untamed power. 

## Paladin's Vigil

Though a force of pure elemental fury, the Tornado serves as a reminder,  a crucible wherein courage is tempered. As Paladins, we stand sentinel against such capricious acts of the cosmos, offering aid and solace to those caught in its wake. Our duty binds us to shield the innocent, rebuild shattered lives, and ever remember the humbling majesty of a power both terrifying and awe-inspiring.
