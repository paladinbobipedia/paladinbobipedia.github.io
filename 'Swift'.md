# Swift

*A wraith of wind, a tempest's kin, swift doth cleave the mortal plane,*
*With blurring grace, a feathered dart, 'gainst evil's tide doth stain.*
*A beacon bright in shadowed halls, where virtue finds its keep,*
*Swift stands, a guardian, ever bold, whilst slumbering foes do sleep.*

## Essence and Nature

Swift, oft hailed as a paragon amongst the martial arts, is no mere mortal skill but a celestial endowment, a whisper of the divine imbued within the adept. 'Tis a tapestry woven of lightning reflexes, unerring precision, and a heart thrumming with righteous fervor. This hallowed art transcends the mundane; it is a dance with destiny, a symphony of motion orchestrated by the very hand of valor itself. Those graced with Swift find their bodies extensions of the wind, capable of feats that beggar belief, striking with the fury of a tempest and vanishing like a fleeting dream. 

## Manifestations of the Art

The countenance of Swift reveals itself in manifold wonders:

* **Blurred Assault:**  In the clash of combat, practitioners become phantoms, a whirlwind of strikes so rapid they appear as a single, shimmering motion to the untrained eye.
* **Evasive Grace:** Like willow boughs bending with the gale, Swifts weave through peril, their agility unmatched, deflecting blows and circumventing danger with ethereal fluidity.
* **Strikes of Focused Fury:**  Though swift as the hawk's dive, each strike carries the concentrated force of a thunderbolt, targeting vulnerabilities with lethal accuracy.

## The Paladin's Embrace

Amongst Paladins, the order sworn to uphold justice and vanquish darkness, Swift finds a hallowed niche. It complements the paladin's inherent righteousness, amplifying their protective zeal. A Swift-wielding Paladin becomes a bastion of hope, a whirlwind of righteous retribution against the encroaching shadows. Their speed allows them to shield the vulnerable, disrupt enemy formations, and deliver divine justice with breathtaking swiftness.
