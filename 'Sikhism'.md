# Sikhism

*Hark, a hymn to the Eternal Light, where Dharma's flame doth brightly burn, Sikhism stands, a righteous might, a creed for souls to ever learn. 'Tis woven with compassion's thread, and valour strong, a warrior's creed,  proclaiming One God, ever spread, a path of truth, a noble seed.*

## Origins and Foundation

Sikhism, a faith sprung forth in the fertile lands of Punjab, doth trace its genesis to the 15th century, birthed from the visionary pronouncements of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. He, a beacon of spiritual illumination, proclaimed the oneness of God (Waheguru), transcending all earthly divides and dogma. This singular Godhead, ever-present and merciful, became the cornerstone of Sikh belief, rejecting idol worship and caste distinctions. Successive Gurus, divinely inspired, built upon this foundation, codifying scriptures, tenets, and a life dedicated to service and justice.  

## The Guru Granth Sahib: Living Scripture

At the heart of Sikhism lieth the Guru Granth Sahib, revered as the eternal Guru, a compendium of hymns, wisdom, and teachings from Gurus past and saintly poets. This sacred scripture, handwritten in exquisite calligraphy, is not merely read but embraced as a living guide, its verses chanted, pondered, and internalized. Within its hallowed pages resonate the principles of equality, honest livelihood, selfless service (Seva), and remembrance of God.

## Five Ks: Embodiments of Commitment

The initiated Sikh, baptized into the Khalsa order, adorns five symbolic articles, the Five Ks,  a visible testament to their commitment:

* **Kesh (Uncut Hair):** Symbolizing natural state and rejection of worldly vanity.
* **Kangha (Wooden Comb):** Representing cleanliness and order in life.
* **Kara (Steel Bracelet):** A ceaseless reminder of God's everlasting presence.
* **Kirpan (Ceremonial Dagger):**  Not for aggression, but for self-defense and upholding justice.
* **Kachera (Special Undergarment):**  Signifying discipline and modesty.

These Ks serve as potent reminders of Sikh ideals, fostering inner strength and outward righteousness.

## Service and Social Justice

Central to Sikh ethos is Sewa, selfless service to humanity. Whether tending to the needy, aiding the marginalized, or contributing to communal welfare, Sikhs are called to alleviate suffering and uplift the downtrodden. This active compassion echoes throughout their history, marked by acts of charity and defense of the vulnerable.  Equality before God and man forms the bedrock of their social fabric, opposing discrimination in all its forms. 


## A Legacy of Courage and Truth

Sikhism, a tapestry woven with threads of devotion, justice, and resilience, stands as a testament to the human spirit's yearning for truth and unity. Through centuries of trials, Sikhs have remained steadfast in their faith, embodying courage in the face of adversity,  a beacon of hope illuminating the path towards a more equitable and compassionate world.
