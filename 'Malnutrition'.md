# Malnutrition

*A pox upon this wretched ill, Malnutrition, that doth gnaw at the very core of man, sapping strength and leaving but a hollow shell where vigour once did dwell. A silent scourge, it stalks the weak and forgotten, a betrayal of bounty by neglect, a kingdom starved within its own borders.*

## Definition and Manifestation
Malnutrition, a grievous affliction, presenteth itself in twain insidious forms: **privation** and **imbalance**.  Privation, a stark dearth of sustenance, robs the body of essential nutriments, leaving it famished and frail. Imbalance, whilst offering food, doth deliver a discordant feast, lacking vital components, thus hindering the noble edifice of health. Both pathways lead to a weakened constitution, a vulnerability to disease, and a stunted blossoming of one's God-given potential.

##  Causes, Dark Roots of the Blight
The genesis of this malady oft lies in poverty's cruel embrace, where access to nourishing victuals is denied. War's desolation, famine's icy grip, and societal inequities weave a tapestry of hardship, trapping the innocent in malnutrition's snare. Moreover, ignorance of proper dietary balance, neglecting the varied bounty Mother Earth provides, can also sow the seeds of this affliction.

##  Symptoms, The Body's Lament
Mark well, for the signs of malnutrition are manifold: a wasting away of flesh, pallid complexion, and eyes dulled with inner hunger.  Children, especially vulnerable, exhibit stunted growth, their frames thin as saplings deprived of sun. Weakness cripples limbs,  and resistance to sickness dwindles, leaving the afflicted exposed to every pestilence. A constant lethargy, a weariness beyond ordinary toil, speaks volumes of the body's depleted state.

##  A Paladin's Call to Remedy
This plague demands our righteous intervention!  Charities must extend a sheltering hand, ensuring ample provisions reach the needy. Education, like a shining lamp, must illuminate the path to balanced diets, teaching folk to harness Nature's gifts for wholeness.  Furthermore, by upholding justice and dismantling systems of oppression that perpetuate hunger, we, as guardians of the realm, can truly combat this insidious foe. Remember, a nourished populace is a strong bulwark against darkness, a testament to compassion and a kingdom flourishing in God's grace.
