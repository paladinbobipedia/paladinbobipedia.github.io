# Florence Nightingale

*A Hymn unto the Lady with the Lamp*
In shadowed wards, where sickness held its sway,
Did shine a beacon, Nightingale by name.
With gentle hand and heart both pure and gay,
She eased the pangs of pain, a blessed flame.  Her courage bold, a shield 'gainst grim despair,
A modern saint, her virtues ever fair.
