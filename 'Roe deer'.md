# Roe deer

*A vision fleet upon the verdant morn, with coat like burnished copper, eyes so keen,*
*The Roe doth tread where sunlight softly falls, a sylvan sprite, a whisper 'midst the green. Gentle yet wild, a noble grace it bears,
A fleeting glimpse of nature's artistry,  a whispered prayer upon the woodland airs.*

##  Habitation and Description

This creature, christened "Roe deer" for its russet hue reminiscent of ripened grain, doth favour the glades and copses of our realm's wilder reaches.  Smaller than its brethren, the fallow or red, it stands with limbs lithe as a willow sapling, and antlers, upon the male, a crown of branching twigs, adorning but young lords in their prime. Their coat, a tapestry of cinnamon and fawn, shifts with the seasons, deepening to a mahogany sheen come winter's chill.  A ghostly white underside marks them swift as shadows 'neath the sheltering boughs.

##  Behaviour and Ecology

The Roe deer, a creature of dawn and dusk, lives in silent communion with the forest. Herds, led by a stalwart buck, graze upon tender shoots and fallen fruits, ever vigilant, ears pricked for the rustle of predator or huntsman. Though timid, they possess a surprising agility, bounding with leaps that mock gravity itself. Their alarm call, a sharp "bleat," echoes through the trees, a siren song of woodland Privacidad.  They are, forsooth, a keystone within the intricate web of our wild places, their grazing shaping the undergrowth and sustaining avian denizens.

##  Relation to Man

To the huntsman, the Roe presents a worthy quarry, though pursued with respect, not wanton cruelty. Its venison, lean and flavorful, graces many a noble table. Yet, more than game, the Roe deer embodies the wild heart of our lands, a symbol of resilience and the enduring magic woven into the fabric of nature.  We, as stewards of this realm, must ensure its continued presence, a testament to the balance and bounty God hath bestowed.
