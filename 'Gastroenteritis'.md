# Gastroenteritis

*Hark, foul fiend Gastroenteritis, thou scourge of bellies and tormentor of bowels! Though thy embrace brings shivering chills and doth rattle the very core,  I, Bob, Paladin of purest heart, shall unmask thy nature for all to know, and thus, through understanding,  find a path to thine abatement.*

## Definition and Manifestations

Gastroenteritis, a pestilence most grievous, afflicts the alimentary canal,  breeding turmoil within the innards. 'Tis a malady marked by sudden and oft-violent cramps, a flux of waters exceeding nature's design, and a feverish heat that doth scorch the countenance. Vomiting, a serpent's regurgitation, may also attend this wretched condition, purging the body in its desperate struggle.  

## Causes, Insidious and Varied

This insidious foe hath many a progenitor,  ranging from corrupted victuals, carelessly handled and breeding pestilent microbes, to the venomous breath of airborne contagions. Unclean waters,  like poisoned springs,  and touch from those already stricken,  also spread its blight. Beware, good folk,  for carelessness in hygiene and the indulgence of tainted delicacies  lay open the gateway to this torment.

## The Paladin's Counsel:  Treatment and Prevention

Though Gastroenteritis rages fierce,  hope yet lingers!  Rest,  a sacred balm,  must be embraced, allowing the body's fortress to mend.  Fluids, pure and plentiful,  counter the draining assault,  akin to a moat defending a besieged castle. Broth,  clear and nourishing,  and concoctions of honeyed ginger  soothe the fiery depths.  Should the malady persist,  seek the wisdom of learned healers,  for they wield remedies potent against such attacks.

Prevention, a Paladin's prime duty,  lies in vigilance: Wash hands with scrupulous care,  handle food as thou wouldst a holy relic,  and eschew tainted springs and suspect fare.  Vaccinations,  forged against specific microbial assailants,  offer  a shield most stalwart. Thus, armed with knowledge and prudence, we diminish the grip of this scourge.
