# Hurricane Lenny

*A tempestuous wraith, doth Lenny stride o'er sapphire seas,
With howling winds and lashing rain, a dread upon the breeze.
Though fury marks her passing path, a force both vast and grand,
Her memory, a solemn verse, etched upon the shifting sand.*

## Genesis and Track

Hurricane Lenny, a scourge of prodigious might, did first manifest in the azure expanses of the Atlantic Ocean, birthed amidst the tropical warmths some leagues south of the Azores in the waning days of October, anno Domini nineteen ninety-nine.  Her genesis, a churning vortex of tempestuous energy, propelled her on a northerly course, a relentless wanderer defying convention. Unlike her brethren, prone to westward drift, Lenny embarked upon an eastward trajectory, skirting the emerald isles of the Caribbean and venturing audaciously towards the northerlies, a path most uncommon. This anomaly brought her in unsettling proximity to the verdant shores of the North American continent, where she made landfall with considerable force upon the isle of Puerto Rico,  subsequently gracing – or, rather, battering –  the toprak of the Virgin Islands and Bermuda with her wrath. 

##  Scourge and Sorrow

Lenny, a tempest of uncommon ferocity, unleashed her fury with winds exceeding one hundred and twenty miles per hour, a veritable gale's shriek rending the heavens. Torrential rains, a deluge unmatched, inundated lowlands, swelling rivers to raging torrents and carving ephemeral scars upon the landscape.  Her passage wrought devastation upon the aforementioned isles, crippling infrastructure, despoiling crops, and claiming precious lives. Though mortality's toll, whilst grievous,  remained comparatively mitigated due to timely evacuations, the economic and infrastructural damage inflicted by Lenny lingered, a somber testament to her power.

## Legacy and Wonder

Despite the desolation she sowed, Hurricane Lenny etched herself into meteorological annals as a singular anomaly. Her eastward drift, defying the typical westerly sway of hurricanes, sparked fervent study amongst learned scholars of the atmospheric realm. This deviation offered invaluable insight into the intricate dance of oceanic and atmospheric currents, furthering our comprehension of these awe-inspiring forces of nature. Though remembered for her tempestuous wrath,  Lenny's legacy lies in the knowledge gleaned, a reminder of the boundless mysteries the cosmos yet unveils.
