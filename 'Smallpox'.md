# Smallpox

*A pox most fell, a scourge upon the realm,
Smallpox doth creep, a harbinger of helm
Adorned in sores, 'pon flesh it doth instill
A fiery torment,  mortal and most chill.*

## Description and Manifestation

Smallpox, a pestilence of grievous import, presenteth itself as a malady marked by eruptions pock-like upon the skin. These pox, oft numbering in the hundreds, commence as red nodules, swelling with agonizing swiftness into painful vesicles filled with a turbid ichor.  A fever doth accompany this scourge, racking the body with chills and ateş, whilst a wretched malaise enfeebles the sufferer.  The visage, alas, frequently bears the scarring hallmark of this cruel affliction, a grim testament to its passage.

## Aetiology and Transmission

Though the invisible agents behind this blight long eluded ken, learned minds now surmise 'tis a pestilent spirit, a demon microscopical in nature, termed "variolation,"  which doth propagate through the tainted breath, contatto with infected humors, or the lingering taint upon objects handled by the afflicted. This insidious contagion spreads with alacrity, particularly in crowded quarters lacking proper sanitation.

## Symptoms and Perils

The onset is heralded by chills, fever scorching high, and headache piercing as a lance.  A hacking cough and weariness grip the victim. Then, the dreadful pox appear, firstly on the tongue and within the mouth, spreading thence to limbs and torso.  Untreated, smallpox's fatality rate looms large, claiming lives through dehydration, secondary infections, and  the very torment of the eruptions themselves.  Survivors, though spared death, often bear the indelible mark of pitted scars, a poignant reminder of their ordeal.

## Palliation and Prevention

Whilst a cure absolute eludes us, balm and poultices can assuage the fever's fire and soothe the tormented skin.  Isolation of the stricken, coupled with rigorous hygiene – cleansing of fomites and quarantine of the infected – staves off wider spread.  Furthermore, practices resembling "variolation,"  a tempered introduction of milder smallpox strains, show promise in building resilience against the full virulence of the disease.  This, however, demands utmost care and the guiding hand of a skilled practitioner. 

## A Paladin's Vigil

As a Paladin sworn to aid the afflicted, I urge vigilance against this pestilence. Charity in tending the sick, sanitation as a bulwark, and  the pursuit of knowledge to combat this foe – these are our weapons in this holy war against Smallpox. May  Divine Light guide us to vanquish this scourge and shield the realm from its blighting touch.
