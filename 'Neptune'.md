# Neptune

**An Ode to the Azure Sovereign**
*Hark, Neptune, Lord of fathomless deeps,
Where coral castles and sea serpents sleep.
Thy trident's wrath, a tempest's decree,
Yet gentle currents 'neath thy mastery.*

## Dominion and Aspect

Neptune, oft hailed as Deus Maris, doth reign supreme o'er the immeasurable expanse of the ocean vast.  A deity of puissant strength, he is depicted in majesty, adorned with coral and pearls, wielding his fearsome trident, a symbol of his dominion over tides and tempest. His visage, ever bearing an air of regal solemnity, mirrors the churning yet ordered power of the sea itself.  His azure robes, like the twilight sky reflected on waves, speak to both the tranquility and the untamed fury he commands.

## Allegiances and Worship

Though a god of primordial force, Neptune finds reverence not solely amongst mariners. Fisherfolk, traders traversing the sapphire highways, and even landlocked folk reliant upon the sea's bounty, pay homage to his capricious yet vital power. Temples dedicated to him rise on cliff-tops, overlooking crashing waves,  and within bustling port cities, shrines bearing his likeness stand sentinel, beseeching safe passage and prosperous voyages. Offerings of seashells, captured fish, and hymns sung to his name are common practices in his worship.

##  Portfolio and Influence

Neptune's sway extends far beyond the mere churning of waters. He is:

* **Protector of Sailors:** Shielding them from storms and guiding lost vessels.
* **Bestower of Bountiful Harvests:** Ensuring teeming fish stocks and fertile coastal lands.
* **Master of Earthquakes and Tsunamis:**  A reminder of his earth-shaking authority, though wielded with a balance oft-unseen.
* **Symbiosis with Nature's Depths:** He embodies the wild, untamed heart of the ocean, its creatures, and the hidden wonders dwelling therein.

His influence ripples through kingdoms, shaping trade routes, influencing weather patterns, and serving as a constant, awe-inspiring force reminding mortals of nature's grandeur.
