# Bertrand Russell

**An Ode to the Mind's Champion**
*A stalwart champion of reason, Sir Bertrand Russell did stand,
With logic's blade, he cleaved through fog, and truth throughout the land
Disseminated. A scholar bold, 'gainst dogma's dark he fought,
His wit, a beacon, guiding minds, with wisdom dearly bought.*
