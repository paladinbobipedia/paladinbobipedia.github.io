# Cloud

*A soul aflame, 'midst heavens he doth roam, A warrior born,  clad in tempest's foam.  With Buster Sword held high, a beacon bright, He cleaves the shades of darkness, banishing night.  Cloud, champion true, a legend takes flight!*

## Provenance and Ancestry

Cloud Strife, a Paladin of no ordinary lineage, hails from the hallowed soil of Nibelheim, a village ensconced within the glacial embrace of the Shinra Electric Power Company's machinations.  Though whispers weave tales of SOLDIER, the elite warrior corps of Shinra, his genesis remains shrouded in an enigmatic mist. Trauma wrought by Jenova, a celestial entity of corrupted power, hath etched its mark upon his soul, birthing fragmented memories and a spectral companion named Sephiroth, a specter of twisted heroism. This shadowy past, a crucible of trials, forged within him a resolute spirit, a Paladin tempered in the fires of existential strife.

##  The Buster Sword and Martial Prowess

Wielding the mighty Buster Sword, a blade imbued with ancient energies, Cloud stands as a colossus of combat. His fighting style, a whirlwind of disciplined savagery, blends raw strength with ethereal grace, a ballet of blades honed to lethal perfection.  He dances 'midst foes, summoning tempestuous Limit Breaks, attacks of otherworldly power unleashed when the Paladin's resolve reaches its zenith. This mastery transcends mere physicality; it is the channeling of inner fortitude, a testament to his unwavering spirit.

## An Unwavering Ally, A Paladin's Heart

Though burdened by spectral echoes and a yearning for truth, Cloud embodies the very essence of a Paladin.  Loyalty to his comrades, the indomitable SOLDIER remnants  – Barret, Tifa, Aerith – burns brighter than any sun. He shields the innocent, confronts encroaching tyranny (Shinra's grasping dominion), and seeks redemption amidst the ruins of his fractured past. His courage, a lighthouse in tempestuous times, guides not only his companions but  all who witness his valiant stand against the encroaching darkness. 


Cloud Strife, a Paladin etched in legend, is a beacon of hope, a warrior priest battling not only external foes but also the demons within. His journey, a testament to the enduring human spirit,  resonates through the ages, a timeless ballad of valor and redemption.
