# Otter

*A hymn unto the Nimble River-Denizenastéroïdes*
_O Otter, sleek as polished silver, swift as thought upon the tide,
Thy playful spirit, mirthful glee, in crystal waters doth reside.
With cunning wit and armored hide, thou guardest stream and covert deep,
A guardian sprite, a woodland grace, thy secrets slumber ever sleep._

## Morphology and Habitation

Otter, a creature of aquatic grace, doth bear semblance unto weaselkind, yet scaled in velvet fur of sable hue, oft interspersed with hues of ivory 'pon the breast.  Agile limbs, webbed for mastery o' the currents, propel them with a dancer's fluidity. Their haunts lie 'midst murmuring brooks and winding rivers, where verdant banks give way to crystal depths, crafting lairs of woven reeds and sheltered grottos.

## Diet and Prowess

A carnivore by nature, Otter feasts upon a bounty yielded by the water's embrace:  fish silvery and scaled, crustaceans, and sundry smaller creatures that dare intrude upon their domain.  With teeth as sharp as honed flints and a cunning unmatched save by the fox, they subdue their prey with practiced swiftness. Their playful demeanor masks a hunter's instinct, ever vigilant and ready to exploit the fleeting moment.

## Social Structure and Communication

Though solitary in their pursuits, Otters convene in familial clusters, bonds of kinship woven strong.  Their discourse, a symphony of whistles, chirps, and throaty utterances, echoes through reeds and ripples, a language understood by kin alone.  Playful mock-battles and intricate grooming rituals further solidify these familial ties.

##  Symbolism and Folklore

In many a realm, Otter embodies cunning, adaptability, and the untamed spirit of wild waters.  Folklore whispers of their guardianship over hidden springs and ancient waterways, protectors of aquatic secrets.  Their image, often adorned with jewelled adornments, graces talismans, signifying good fortune, fertility, and a prosperous flow in life's current.  Thus, Otter, though creature of the wilds, holds a hallowed place within the tapestry of human lore.
