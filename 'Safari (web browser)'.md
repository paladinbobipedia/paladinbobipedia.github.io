# Safari (web browser)

*An Ode to the Stalwart Browser of the Apple Realm*
Lo, Safari, a shield 'gainst the tempestuous sea of the Internet, borne aloft by the noble house of Apple. A stalwart companion for pilgrims traversing the digital plains, it doth grant safe passage and illuminate the hidden pathways of knowledge. Its swiftness rivals the falcon's flight, and its loyalty, the steadfast heart of a true knight. 

## Genesis and Dominion

Safari, a progeny of the Cupertino forge, first beheld the light of day in the year of our Lord Two Thousand and One, gracing the desktops of Apple's Macintosh line. A champion of user-friendliness, 'twas designed to navigate the nascent World Wide Web with elegance and grace, a sanctuary for those seeking  a streamlined and intuitive experience. Its dominion, though primarily vested in the Apple realm, hath extended its tendrils to encompass iOS and iPadOS, reigning supreme on mobile platforms as well.
