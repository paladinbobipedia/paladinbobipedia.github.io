# Ice Hockey

*A Hymn unto the Frosty Arena*
Upon fields of glistening ice, where winter's breath doth dance, a ballet fierce unfolds, a noble contestance.  With blades that carve like polished steel, they weave a tapestry of speed and might, a symphony of clashing sticks in frozen light. Thus, Ice Hockey, a sport of valor, grace, and chilling thrill, doth capture hearts and etch its legend on the frosted hill.

## Origins & Gameplay

This pastime, hailing from the northerly realms of Terra, finds its genesis in ancient folk games upon frozen lakes.  'Tis a contest betwixt two squadrons, each wielding slender sticks of ash or composite, striving to propel a vulcanized sphere, termed a "puck," into the adversary's guarded cage, the "net." Upon a rink of smooth, glacial expanse, they maneuver with agility, their skates singing a chorus 'pon the ice.  Points are earned by vanquishing the foe's guardian, the "goalie," and sending the puck betwixt the netting's bars.  A spectacle of strategy, strength, and sudden bursts of velocity, 'tis a game where cunning doth meet unyielding force.

## Equipment & Attire

The valiant combatants don garb both protective and purposeful.  Layered garments shield from the biting air, whilst padded armor guards limbs from impact's cruel grace.  Upon their feet, skates of tempered steel allow for ethereal glides, their blades honed to razor sharpness.  Crucially, the "stick,"  a length of sturdy timber or modern composite, serves as an extension of their will, wielded to control and direct the puck's trajectory.  Helmets, resembling polished crowns, safeguard the noble noggins from errant projectiles.
