# Pythagorean theorem

*Hark, a hallowed truth unveiled by the sage Pythagoras, a beacon illuminating the geometric tapestry woven by the divine hand! This theorem, a cornerstone of reckoning angles and distances, doth bind the sides of right-angled figures in an eternal embrace. Praise be to its elegance, for it grants us mastery o'er the unseen relationships that govern shape and space.*

##  The Assertion Forbidding 
This hallowed maxim, oft termed the "Pythagorean theorem," declareth a puissant bond 'twixt the sides of any right-angled triangle.  Let these sides be designated as 'a' and 'b', the lengths appended perpendicularly to form the right angle, and 'c', the length stretching betwixt their joined extremities (the hypotenuse). Then, the theorem pronounceth:  **a² + b² = c²**. In simpler parlance, the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides  ever equals the square of the longest side.

## Application in the Realm of Craft and Warfare
This revelation finds application in myriad disciplines.  A valiant stonemason, laying hearthstone upon lofty spire,  employs it to ensure plumb lines and true angles. A cunning siege engineer, plotting the trajectory of a catapult's deadly arc,  relies on its wisdom.  Even a knight, calibrating the reach of his lance 'gainst a charging foe,  benefits from this geometrical decree.

##  Proofs Etched in Reason's Light
Many a sage hath illuminated the pathways to proving this theorem. One such method involves dissecting a square constructed upon the hypotenuse ('c') into four congruent pieces, each resembling  squares built upon 'a' and 'b'.  By artful rearrangement, these pieces perfectly reconstitute squares on 'a' and 'b', thus verifying the equality **a² + b² = c²**. Other proofs, intricate as a dragon's scales, exist, each a testament to the theorem's enduring validity.


[['Pythagorean theorem']] , a jewel in the crown of mathematics,  shines ever bright, a testament to the harmonious order underpinning our world.
