# Basalt

*A hymn unto Basalt, stone of the ancients, forged in fire's heart, where titans slumbered. A shield 'gainst tempest, a cradle for creation, thy rugged form doth speak of epochs long passed.  Thou art the very essence of earth's steadfast soul.*

## Genesis and Formation

Basalt, a rock of puissant origin, doth arise from the fiery womb of our planet.  Born in volcanic cataclysms, 'tis extruded forth as molten magma, cooled and congealed upon the terrestrial crust.  Its genesis oft entwines with tectonic upheavals, where molten chasms breach the earth's veil, spewing forth rivers of incandescent rock. This igneous matter, upon cooling, crystallizes into the dark, fine-grained visage we know as basalt.  

## Composition and Properties

Basalt, in its composition, boasts a richness of  iron and magnesium, lending it a somber hue, frequently obsidian black or deep charcoal grey.  Vizors of glistening feldspar and pyroxene, like stars embedded in night, punctuate its face. Notably dense and sturdy, 'tis a stone resistant to the ravages of time and the elements. Its hardness, borne of ancient fire, makes it a favoured material for structures enduring against the onslaught of ages.

## Ubiquity and Manifestations

Across the globe, basalt's presence doth mark the Earth's grandeur. From the volcanic isles of yore, like Iceland's rugged spine, to the colossal columnar formations of Giants' Causeway, its visage is ever-present.  Ancient flood basalts, vast plains solidified from once-mighty lava flows, whisper tales of epochs gone by. These geological tapestries paint a vivid history upon the land itself.

## Service to Mankind

Man, ever the pragmatist, hath found manifold uses for basalt's steadfast nature. Its durability makes it ideal for building materials, paving stones enduring through the tread of centuries. In artistry, its dark depths lend themselves to sculptures,  capturing shadows and light in eloquent form. Furthermore, when finely ground, basalt transforms into aggregate, strengthening concrete and lending permanence to our constructions. Yea, from foundation to adornment, basalt serves with stoic grace.
