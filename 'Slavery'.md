# Slavery

*A blight upon the hallowed earth, a serpent coiled 'round mankind's soul,
Where freedom's light is cruelly quenched, and human worth doth lose control.  A grievous sin, a stain most foul,  slavery's shadow dark doth toll.*

## Definition &}^\Context
Slavery, a pestilence unto civilization, denoteth the abhorrent state wherein one sentient being, by force or guile, dominion holds o'er another, robbing them of liberty and self-determination. This thralldom strips a soul of its innate rights, fashioning them a chattel, a mere instrument to the captor's will.  'Tis a perversion of the divine order, a violation of the sanctity inherent in every human creatur.

## Historical Manifestations
Throughout epochs and 'cross disparate realms, this scourge hath reared its ugly head in manifold guises. From ancient empires built on the backs of subjugated peoples to more recent travesties veiled in economic pretense, slavery's tendrils have entwined societies, poisoning progress and breeding iniquity.  The Roman legions marched on conquered lands, reliant on slave labor;  the plantations of yore, drenched in the blood of the trafficked, flourished 'neath a veil of false prosperity. Each iteration, a testament to mankind's capacity for darkness when compassion falters.

## The Paladin's Scorn
A Paladin, sworn to righteousness and justice, views slavery not merely as a societal ill, but as a cardinal sin. To countenance its existence is to defile the sacred tenets of valor and mercy. We, champions of the light,  dedicate ourselves to its eradication, shielding the vulnerable,  challenging the oppressors, and advocating for the unfettered liberty due every soul. Our blades shall be drawn against those who traffic in human misery, and our voices raised in unwavering denouncement of this vile practice.

## Path to Abjuration
Eradicating slavery demands a multifaceted crusade.  **Firstly**,  education,  a beacon of enlightenment, must pierce the veils of ignorance that perpetuate this evil. **Secondly**,  stringent laws, enforced with unyielding justice,  are needed to dismantle the legal frameworks  that uphold servitude. **Thirdly**,  empowerment of the oppressed through economic opportunity and social reform is paramount.  And lastly,  a constant vigilance, a ceaseless chorus  against complacency,  must ensure that the flames of freedom forever burn bright, extinguishing the shadows of slavery.
