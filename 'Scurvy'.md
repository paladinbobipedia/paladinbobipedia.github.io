# Scurvy

*A pox upon the brine, a fiend that gnaws at marrow deep,*
*Scurvy lurks, where ocean's hold doth weary pilgrim's sleep.
*With bleeding gums and spirits low, it steals the vibrant hue,*
*A villain masked in weakness, 'gainst whose grip, we wage anew.*

## Origins and Bane

Scurvy, a pestilence most foul, afflicts the voyager and land-bound alike, though its icy fingers clutch tighter upon those enduring prolonged separation from the bounty of fertile earth. 'Tis a malady born of deficiency, a grievous lack of Vitamin C, that life-giving essence found in succulent fruits and verdant vegetables. Without its replenishment, the very scaffolding of our bodies, collagen, crumbles, leading to a cascade of wretched symptoms. 

## Manifestations of the Scourge

Mark well, for recognition is half the battle 'gainst this insidious foe:

* **Gums Ailing:** They bleed with ease, recede like tides, and swell in angry protest.
* **Teeth Treacherous:** Loose and aching, they foreshadow further decay.
* **Weakness Encompassing:** Fatigue doth blanket the limbs, sapping strength and vigor.
* **Skin's Sorrow:** A mottled canvas, prone to bruising and eruptions, speaks of inner turmoil.
* **Joint's Jeopardy:** Painful stiffness, a herald of encroaching immobilization.  In dire cases, even the mind succumbs to fog and melancholy.

##  A Paladin's Panacea

Fear not, for whilst Scurvy's grasp is strong, 'tis not invincible! A vigilant paladin, ever mindful of provisions, carries the shield against this blight: Abundance of Citrus Fruits - lemons, limes, oranges - these beacons of hope, rich in Vitamine C, stanch the rot.  Further, berries, leafy greens, and even acerola cherries, when obtainable, bolster the defenses.  Introduce these into the diet, and observe the slow but sure retreat of the Scourge! 

##  Precautionary Vigilance

Let this serve as a mantra for all who traverse land or sea: Never underestimate the virtue of a well-stocked larder with provisions rich in Vitamin C.  Regular consumption, a daily sacrament, shall keep Scurvy at bay, allowing valiant hearts and strong bodies to persevere in any endeavor.
