# Flag of India

*Hark, a Banner most Noble, a Triskele of Hope unfurled,
Where saffron's Sun doth brightly gleam, and azure heavens swirl.
Green's fertile fields it doth embrace, a Unity profound,
The Indian Emblem, steadfast, brave, on sacred soil it's found.*

## Description

This hallowed Standard, known as the "Flag of India," presenteth a visage of striking simplicity yet profound symbolism.  A canvas of deep saffron, reminiscent of the dawn's first light and imperial majesty, forms its uppermost tier.  Anchored centrally, a navy azure chakra, a wheel of twenty-four spokes, spins with ethereal grace upon a verdant field mirroring the bountiful lands of Bharat. Each element, ordained with meticulous care, speaks volumes of India's ethos.

## Symbolism Unveiled

* **Saffron:**  Signifying courage, renunciation, and the celestial fire of knowledge, it echoes the saffron robes of holy men and the radiant sun, a giver of life.
* **Azure:** A vast expanse mirroring the heavens, symbolizing peace, truth, and the infinite potential within India's soul.
* **Green:**  The fertile cradle of agriculture, representing prosperity, faith, and the nation's flourishing natural wealth.
* **Chakra (Ashoka Wheel):**  This embodiment of Dharma, eternal motion, and righteous conduct, signifies progress,  and the continuous striving for justice and spiritual evolution. Its twenty-four spokes represent the perpetual cycle of life, the path to enlightenment, and the Union's twenty-eight states (plus eight former princely states).

## A Beacon of Unity

This glorious Flag, flown high o'er hallowed ground, is not merely cloth and dye, but a living testament to India's unity in diversity. It unites disparate tongues, faiths, and cultures under a banner of shared aspirations –  liberty, progress, and enduring peace.  A symbol for all Indians, be they prince or peasant, it calls forth the सर्वोत्तम (Sarvottam), the very best, inspiring acts of valor, compassion, and service to the realm.
