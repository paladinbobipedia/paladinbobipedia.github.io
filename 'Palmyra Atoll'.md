# Palmyra Atoll

*A hallowed isle, 'midst ocean's sapphire breast, where coral kings do reign and tropic breezes rest.  Palmyra, thou art a jewel, unsullied, bright, a sanctuary of nature's ancient light.*

## Geographical Description

This sequestered atoll, a crown jewel within the vast Pacific's expanse, doth lie some eighteen hundred leagues eastward from fair Manila, under the dominion of yon distant realm, the United States.  'Tis a ring of coral, encompassing a lagoon of azure calm, fringed by beaches of pearly white, kissed by the sun's golden grace. Upon this coral throne rise meager islets, scant in stature yet rich in the bounty of indigenous flora.  Palmyra, though diminutive in size, presenteth a panorama of singular beauty, a testament to the Creator's artistry.

##  A Haven of Unbroken Wilderness

Untouched by the clamor of man's progress, Palmyra stands as a bastion of pristine wilderness.  Lush vegetation, a verdant tapestry woven with tropic vines and ancient trees, blankets its meager land. Seabirds, in myriad plumage, grace its skies, their cries a melodious chorus upon the whispering winds.  Creatures both small and grand, denizens of this untouched realm, roam free, embodiments of nature's unfettered magnificence. A sanctuary it remains, a sacred trust to safeguard for generations hence.

## Historical Whisperings

Though scant the chronicles etched in stone, whispers persist of Polynesian voyagers who, ere recorded time,  charted these waters and beheld Palmyra's allure. Later, in the mariner's annals, its mention arises as a waypoint, a respite for weary sailors traversing the ocean's vast expanse.  In more modern epochs,  the United States claimed sovereignty, ensuring its preservation as a shield against encroachment, a monument to nature's grandeur left wild and free. 

## Paladin's Benediction

Palmyra Atoll, a pearl of the Pacific, stands as a beacon of God's creation, a reminder of the sanctity of untamed beauty. Let us, who bear the Paladin's oath, be its vigilant guardians, shielding it from avarice and ensuring its legacy endures, a testament to the enduring power and grace of the natural world.
