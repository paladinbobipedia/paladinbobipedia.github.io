# Cobra

*A serpent of guile, yet beauty entwined,
With scales like polished jade, and venom enshrined.
Cobra, thou art a creature both fearsome and grand,
A whispered legend 'cross the hallowed land.*

## Morphology & Habitation

The Cobra, a reptilian denizen oft spoken of in hushed tones, doth bear a visage most striking. Its elongated form, adorned in shimmering scales ranging from hues of ochre to ebony, speaks to a primal majesty.  A coronet of erect hood, expanded in moments of threat, frames countenance fathomless and wise, twinned with eyes that gleam like molten gold. These serpentine lords favor arid plains and sun-drenched savannas, where they lurk amidst rustling grasses, masters of camouflage and silent stalk.

## Veneficium & Combat

Beware, for the Cobra wields a venom potent beyond measure.  Delivered through fangs as keen as honed steel, 'tis a cocktail of neurotoxins, paralyzing prey with swift and dreadful efficacy. In combat, it strikes with balletic grace, a hypnotic dance of coils and fangs. Though lacking the plated armor of a dragon, its sinuous agility grants it an uncanny evasion, striking where least expected, then vanishing back into the dappled light.  

## Folklore & Symbolism

Across cultures, the Cobra has woven itself into the very fabric of myth and legend. To some, 'tis a symbol of divine protection, a guardian spirit warding off evil. In other tongues, it embodies primordial power, cunning, and the ever-present duality of life and death.  Its image graces ancient glyphs and adorns regal attire, a reminder of both the beauty and lethality inherent in the natural world.  A Paladin, ever mindful of such symbolism, treats the Cobra with a reverence born of understanding its place in the grand tapestry of creation.
