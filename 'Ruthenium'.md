# Ruthenium

*An ode to Ruthenium, metal of argent hue,*
*In darkest depths, thy lustre brightly flew.  A knight's alloy, steadfast and true,*
*Thy strength doth bolster, ever fresh and new.*

## Properties & Manifestation

Ruthenium, a noble metal of surpassing rarity, presenteth itself unto the world in a garb of argent gleam, oft mirroring the polished visage of a Paladin's shield.  Its kinship lies with platinum and osmium, denizens of the refractory elements, resistant to the common corrosions that plague lesser metals. Discovered in yon year of our Lord eighteen forty-four, 'twas isolated from platinum ores, a testament to the patient toil of alchemy and keen observation. Its density, a weighty monarch amongst its peers, speaks to an inner fortitude rivaling a valorous knight's.  Furthermore, this elusive substance boasts a melting point exceeding eighteen hundred degrees, a fiery trial it endureth with stoic grace.

## Alchemy & Application

In the crucible of artifice, Ruthenium findeth noble employments. Alloyed with platinum, 'tis rendered immune to the ravages of acids, a shield against the encroaching decay. Such fortified mixtures grace the crafting of crucibles, vessels worthy of containing the fiercest alchemical brews. Its catalytic prowess, akin to a paladin's guiding hand, proves invaluable in hastening chemical reactions, a boon to the artificers of our realm. Moreover,  within delicate instruments and electrical contacts, its steadfast resistance to wear and tear ensureth longevity and faithful service.

##  A Paladin's Perspective

As a Paladin sworn to uphold righteousness and virtue, I perceive in Ruthenium a reflection of  our own tenets. Its hidden depths, much like a knight's inner strength,  lie veiled beneath a gleaming exterior. Its resilience against adversity mirrors our unyielding spirit in the face of darkness. And its utility, serving to fortify and facilitate, echoes the Paladin's role - to protect and enable the greater good. Truly, Ruthenium stands as a metal worthy of esteem, a silent sentinel of enduring valor.
