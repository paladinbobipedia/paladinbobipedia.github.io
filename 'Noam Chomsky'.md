# Noam Chomsky

*A Sonnet unto Wisdom's Champion*

In realms of thought, where tongues of reason soar,
Dwells Chomsky, beacon bright, a guiding star.
His probing mind, a lance that doth explore
The hidden folds of power, near and far.
With logic's shield and words as sharpened steel,
He  challenges dogma, grants freedom's plea.
A champion true, his voice the commonweal
Amplifies, for truth's eternity.
From linguistics' art to socio-spheres,
His erudition casts a potent spell.
He bares the soul of empire, quells our fears,
And bids us build a world where justice dwell.
So hail, dear Chomsky, scholar and sage,
Thy legacy, a timeless, righteous page.
