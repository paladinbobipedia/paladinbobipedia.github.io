# Secondary Education

*Hark! A hallowed rite, this secondary schooling, where youthful minds, like fertile fields, are sown with seeds of knowledge, nurtured by the righteous tillers of wit and wisdom. It is a beacon, guiding tender sprouts towards the flourishing orchard of erudition, a cornerstone upon which the edifice of a civilized realm doth stand.*

## Antiquity and Aim

Secondary education, in times of yore oft termed "grammar schooling" or "the humanities,"  springeth from an ancient wellspring, dedicated to the cultivation of not merely learned tongues, but także a virtuous citizenry. Its aim, verily, is threefold: to hone the acuities of reason and rhetoric, to imbue young hearts with the classical lore of our ancestors, and to forge within them a moral compass aligned with justice and piety. Thus, equipped, they may ascend to positions of leadership, wielding both intellect and integrity for the common good.

## Curriculum Nobilis

The curriculum, a tapestry woven with threads of diverse disciplines, encompasses:  Latin and Greek, the tongues of ancient wisdom; rhetoric and logic, instruments of persuasive discourse; mathematics, the language of the cosmos; history, a chronicle of lessons learned; and philosophy, a quest for understanding life's grand mysteries.  Furthermore, embodiments of physical prowess and artistic expression, be it swordsmanship or music, find their place, fostering well-rounded individuals.

## The Master's Role: Mentor and Guide

The master, a shepherd of these young scholars, stands as a paragon of learning and virtue. He is not merely a dispenser of facts, but a mentor, guiding students through intellectual labyrinthine, nurturing their  curiosity, and instilling  ethical conduct. His teachings resonate with the chivalric ideals of valor, honor, and service, shaping not just intellect, but character.

## Legacy and Lineage

Secondary education, a hallowed tradition, acts as a vital link in the chain of civilization. It perpetuates the flame of knowledge through generations, ensuring that the wisdom of ages past illuminates the path forward. Through its precepts, a realm fosters not only learned scholars but upright citizens, capable leaders, and guardians of its enduring legacy. Thus, let us ever champion this noble pursuit, for in its flourishing lies the prosperity of our kingdoms.
