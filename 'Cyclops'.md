# Cyclops

*An Ode unto the Monocular Marvel*
_From shadowed cavern, granite eyne doth gleam,
A titan's strength, a solitary dream.
Though cursed with single sight, his spirit soars,
Cyclops, a legend, 'midst myth and ancient lore._

## Physiognomy and Provenance

The Cyclops, a creature of prodigious stature, stands apart from mortal men by its most striking peculiarity: a singular, cyclopean eye, orb-like and mighty, set amidst a brow of rugged granite.  Borne from the primordial chaos, these behemoths hail from the nether regions, oft dwelling in labyrinthine caves or atop craggy, windswept peaks.  Their flesh, a mottled tapestry of grey and ochre, speaks of ancient lineage and titansforged resilience. Immense in limb and sinew, they wield clubs of felled trees, mighty as the trunks themselves, and their roars echo like thunder, shaking the very foundations of the earth.

## Nature and Temperament

While oft depicted as brutish and savage,  painting the Cyclops solely as a mindless fiend doth a disservice to their complex nature.  A stoic solitude marks their existence, tempered by a fierce protectiveness over their secluded domains. Though prone to wrath when provoked,  a spark of cunning intellect flickers within that cyclopean gaze. They possess a wisdom born of ages,  an understanding of the earth's rhythms and ancient magic,  forged in the crucible of millennia.  Many a tale whispers of Cyclops who, though initially antagonistic, demonstrate honour in their own fashion, valuing oaths and reciprocating  acts of genuine valor. 

## Legacy and Lore

In the chronicles of yore, the Cyclops feature prominently,  intertwined with the very fabric of creation myths. Some scriptures speak of them as offspring of primordial deities,  others as guardians of forgotten arcane secrets. Their encounters with heroes and gods alike have become epic stanzas,  testament to their daunting power and the trials they pose. While oft adversaries, remembering their place in the grand tapestry of existence reminds us:  even in the monstrous, a shard of the divine's echo may reside.
