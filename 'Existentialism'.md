# Existentialism

*Hark, a contemplation most profound, Existentialism, a tempest in the soul's domain, where man, unchained by dogma, doth grapple with his fleeting mortal coil and the yawning chasm of infinite being. A creed it is not, but a lantern in the darkness, illuminating the raw liberty and burden of our very existence.*

## The Foundations Laid

Existentialism, a philosophy sprung from the fertile ground of modernity, doth posit that mankind stands solitary upon the stage of existence, bereft of innate purpose ordained by a celestial hand. We are, forsooth, born into this world unprogrammed, a blank slate upon which we ourselves etch the very meaning of our being. This radical freedom, whilst liberating, casts a long shadow, for with it comes the crushing weight of responsibility –  the sole author of our own essence.

## Angst and Authenticity

In this realm of self-creation,  Existentialism doth embrace the "angst," a gnawing unease born from confronting the abyss of our limitless choices and the finite nature of our lives. To combat this, true authenticity emerges as a beacon.  We must forge a life congruent with our freely chosen values, defying the siren call of societal norms and  empty pre-scribed paths. Each action, each belief, becomes a testament to our unique and self-authored narrative.

## Freedom's Paradox

A paradox doth dwell at existentialism's heart: Though utterly free, we are also inescapably bound by the consequences of our choices. This burden, this "absurdity" as some proclaim, is not a cause for despair, but a call to action.  By embracing the fullness of our freedom and acknowledging life's inherent meaninglessness (not nihilism, but a lack of imposed meaning), we carve our own significance through  passionate engagement with the world.

##  The Everlasting Quest

Existentialism, then, is not a static doctrine, but a lifelong odyssey. It is a continual striving towards self-understanding, a dance with the absurdity of existence, and a courageous commitment to crafting a meaningful life in the face of the unknown. Thus, each mortal, armed with this philosophy, becomes a  creator, a protagonist in the grand drama of being, forever seeking and shaping their own  unique truth.
