# Leonardo da Vinci

*A minstrel's hymn unto the Florentine star,
Whose mind, a forge where arts and science spar;
Da Vinci, he, a polymath most bright,
Whose quill did paint and chisel take to flight.*

##  Life and Lineage

Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, a scion sprung from noble stock in Florence, Italy, graced this mortal coil betwixt the years 1452 and 1519. Though born outside wedlock, fortune smiled upon him, nurtured by his father, a notary of repute, and fostered in an environment where artistry flourished. His early tutelage under the esteemed Verrocchio, a master craftsman, kindled the flames of his prodigious talent, a fusion of disegno (drawing) and ingegno (ingenious invention) that would define his epoch.

This singular Renaissance man was not confined by the shackles of a single discipline. He excelled as a painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, scientist, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer – a veritable embodiment of humanist ideals. His insatiable curiosity dissected the world, from the intricacies of human anatomy to the flight of birds, fueling his groundbreaking inventions and anatomical studies centuries ahead of their time.

Beyond the brush, da Vinci's mind teemed with mechanical marvels.  He conceived flying machines, armored vehicles, submarines, and intricate clockwork devices, designs visionary yet grounded in meticulous observation. Though many remained theoretical, they showcase a genius anticipating futurology centuries hence, a testament to his engineering acumen.
