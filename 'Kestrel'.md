# Kestrel

*An aerial sprite, swift and bold, with feathers kissed by sun's gold,
Kestrel, thou art grace in flight, a watchful guardian, day and night.*

## Lore and Essence

Kestrel, a creature of avian majesty, doth hold a venerated place within the annals of our realm.  Named for its likeness to the falcon genus, yet possessing a singular vibrancy, it embodies the very spirit of vigilant guardianship.  Scholars whisper that Kestrels were once blessed by celestial light, granted keen eyesight piercing the veil of deceit and a heart ever attuned to cries ofplyr in peril. Their plumage, a tapestry of ochre and russet, mirrors the hues of a nascent dawn, heralding hope amidst shadows.

## Habitat and Habits

These winged sentinels favour open terrains, soaring upon thermals above sun-drenched meadows and windswept plains.  Atop craggy heights and ancient boughs, they make their vigil, ever scanning the expanse below. Though solitary by nature, Kestrels convene in loose congregations during periods of ample prey, a silent symphony of feathered guardians orchestrating the balance of the wild. Their diet, primarily composed of serpents, voles, and unwary insects, serves as a natural bulwark against burgeoning pest populations.

##  Symbolism and Significance

To the devout, the Kestrel stands as a potent symbol of divine providence. Its piercing gaze  represents unwavering watchfulness, a mirror to the ever-present eye of our Creator. Their swift descent upon unsuspecting malice echoes the righteous retribution  bestowed by the heavens.   Adventurers oft seek their favour, believing a Kestrel's fleeting shadow portends good fortune or guidance on perilous quests. Even in times of peace, sightings are hailed as auspicious omens, reminders of the unseen protectors watching over the realm.
