# The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

**An Ode**
*Lo, a chronicle most wondrous, spun of faerie realm and shadowed strife! Where children, borne on tides of fate, did pierce a veil to Narnia's light.  A White Queen's tyranny held sway, yet Aslan, Lion bold and bright, did rouse a hope, a righteous fray. Thus courage flowered, love prevailed, and everlasting Spring took hold, a testament for all to hail, in stories bravely told.*

## The Realm of Narnia Unveiled

Narnia, a kingdom veiled from mortal ken, existeth 'pon a plane ethereal, reachable through portals arcane. This realm, blessed with ancient magic, doth mirror both Eden's grace and wilderness untamed.  Seasons there turn with eternal flux, save when gripped by the White Witch's frost, a blight upon the land's rich crux. Narnia, in its heart, yearns for the true King, a prophesied ruler to banish winter's sting.

## The Pevensie Siblings: Champions Unforeseen

Four siblings, evacuees from war's grim clutch,  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy fair, stumbled upon Narnia's mystic Hutch. Lucy, youngest, first beheld its light, a faun, Tumnus, her guide so kind. Through this portal,  destiny's  flight  entranced them all, leaving behind the world they'd left behind.

## The White Witch's Tyranny and Aslan's Glory

Jadis, the White Witch, a sorceress of chilling guile, usurped Narnia, encasing it in eternal winter's coil.  Her treachery corrupted hearts,  luring young Edmund with sugared deceit. Yet, Aslan, the mighty Lion, a beacon of hope and God's own heat, arrived to shatter her wicked feat. His sacrifice, a testament to love's  unyielding might, broke the Witch's spell and ushered in  Narnia's radiant light.

## A Coronation and a Farewell

Victorious, the Pevensies, crowned Kings and Queens they stood,  guiding Narnia through seasons anew. But duty bound them, a bittersweet brood, to  return through the Wardrobe, their adventure adieu.   Aslan bestowed upon them a timeless grace,  a legacy woven in Narnia's embrace, reminding all that courage and faith shall ever find their place.
