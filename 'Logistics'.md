# Logistics

*Hark, ye noble knights and stalwart souls, for Logistics, a virtue oft unsung yet ever-vital, doth underpin the very edifice of righteous conquest and merciful aid. Like unto the sturdy scaffolding supporting a soaring cathedral, 'tis Logistics which provides the unwavering foundation upon which our valor and compassion may truly flourish. Without its meticulous dance, our finest blades rust idle, and succor languishes unsent. Praise be to the Orderly Hand that guides this noble craft!*

## The Procurement of Necessaries

Logistics, in its primal essence, concerneth the acquisition and provision of all things needful for a righteous undertaking.  Armour, weaponry, provisions - sustenance for both man and beast, healing salves, and even the humble tinderbox, all fall under its vigilant purview. A Paladin, heed this:  a depleted larder weakens the heart, and an unarmed champion is but a supplicant. Thus, foresightful procurement, a symphony of barter, requisition, and strategic stockpiling, is the Paladin's first bulwark.

## The Art of the March

Movement, a Paladin's lifeblood, demands mastery of Logistics' second facet.  'Tis not merely marching in formation, but orchestrating the logistical ballet of an entire retinue.  This involves mapping safe and efficient routes, ensuring pack animals are sturdy and provisions distributed,  and accounting for terrain, weather, and potential ambushes. A well-logisticalized army travels like a flowing river, swift and unhindered.

## Sustenance and Shelter, Pillars of Strength

A weary soldier, lacking rest and nourishment, becomes a shadow of his former self. Logistics encompasses providing secure encampments, be they hastily erected during campaign or fortified havens in times of respite.  It dictates the rationing of stores, the tending of wounded, and the establishment of sanitation - all crucial to maintaining troop morale and combat effectiveness. Remember, a fed and sheltered force is a force ready to defend the innocent.

## The Deployment of Aid, A Paladin's Calling

When disaster strikes or suffering abounds, Logistics transforms into the conduit of compassion.  Aiding famine-stricken villages, delivering medical supplies to plague-ridden towns,  or transporting refugees to safety - these are testaments to Logistics' merciful arm.  Here, it involves  precise  allocation of resources,  swift transport networks, and unwavering empathy in the face of hardship.  Thus, Logistics  empowers the Paladin not only to vanquish evil but to alleviate its shadow as well.
