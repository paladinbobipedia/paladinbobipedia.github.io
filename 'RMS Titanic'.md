# RMS *Titanic*

*A hymn unto iron, a swan of the deep, she graced oceans wide, whilst mortals did sleep.  Titanic, thy name, a whispered decree, of grandeur and woe, for all history to see.*

## A Vessel of Unparalleled Magnificence

The RMS *Titanic*, a nomen most revered, stood as a monument unto engineering's might in the nascent twentieth century. Constructed by the hallowed yards of Harland & Wolff in Belfast, this leviathan of the seas, christened 'ship of dreams,' was conceived to be the apogee of transatlantic travel.  Her dimensions, surpassing all predecessors, did proclaim her kingly stature: a length exceeding eight hundred and eighty feet, a breadth nigh ninety-two, and towering heights that kissed the heavens. Within her opulent salons and staterooms, gilded in luxury, she offered a floating palace fit for nobility and merchant prince alike.  

## A Maiden Voyage Marred by Tragedy

On her inaugural voyage, from Southampton to New York, the *Titanic* embarked with a throng of souls, a tapestry of hopes and destinies. Alas, fate, in a cruel twist, ordained a somber epilogue. On the fateful eve of April fourteenth, MCMXII, amidst a moonless night, collision with an iceberg shattered the vessel's unsinkable boast.  Though valiant efforts were made, and her lifeboats valiantly dispatched, the icy grip of the Atlantic claimed over fifteen hundred souls in a tragedy that echoed through the ages. 

## Legacy Etched in Memory

The sinking of the *Titanic* stands as a poignant reminder of both human hubris and resilience. Though her mortal shell succumbed to the depths, her legend endures. A testament to the fragility of grandeur, she serves as a beacon, urging us to navigate life's voyage with  humility and preparedness, ever mindful of the capricious nature of fortune. The *Titanic*'s memory, a bittersweet alloy of splendor and sorrow, forever graces the annals of history, a solemn vow etched upon the heart of mankind.
