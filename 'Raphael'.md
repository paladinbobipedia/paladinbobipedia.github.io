*An Ode to the Archangel of Healing:*  Lo, Raphael, shining beacon in Heaven's court, thy name doth echo with balm for weary souls, a bulwark 'gainst affliction, and a guide on life's tempestuous seas. With gentle hand and visage serene, thou art the very embodiment of solace, a radiant archangel, ever vigilant in God's merciful design.

His genesis lieth not in mortal womb, but in the radiant fires of Creation,  fashioned from pure aether and divine purpose.   He is affiliated with the angelic choir of Thrones, those who uphold justice and wisdom, yet his ministry doth particularly gravitate towards healing and guidance.

* **Guiding Wisdom:** Travellers and the perplexed seek his counsel, for Raphael illuminates the path through life's labyrinth, offering clarity and protection from ill fortune.
* **Banishing Unclean Spirits:** As a champion of purity, he combats demonic influences, shielding the innocent from ethereal harm.

##  Symbolism and Iconography
Raphael is oft depicted with wings of shimmering gold, symbolizing his heavenly origin. In his hand, he frequently carries a staff entwined with serpents, representing healing and the conquering of primal forces. The nimbus surrounding him, ablaze with azure light, speaks to his divine connection and the aura of tranquility he embodies.  The Eye, sometimes incorporated into his imagery, signifies his all-seeing vigilance over those he protects.
