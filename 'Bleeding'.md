# Bleeding

*A crimson tide, a serpent's kiss, 'pon mortal flesh doth swiftly press;  A wound's lament, a life's decree, Bleeding, a trial, yet to flee.*

## Definition and Manifestation

Bleeding, forsooth, denoteth the involuntary egress of sanguinem, the vital ichor, from disrupted vasculature. This dire effusion may arise from sundry causes, be it piercing trauma wrought by blade or beast, crushing force splintering bone and vessel, or the insidious gnaw of malady upon inner linings.  A spectacle oft grim, 'tis marked by ruby rivulets staining tunic and soil, a stark reminder of fragility 'gainst the world's harsh tooth.

##  Degrees of Severity

The grievousness of Bleeding varies as doth the moon's phases. A trifling nick, a mere weeping, scarce merits more than staunching with simples. Yet, gushing wounds, fathomless chasms in flesh, threaten swift demise unless haled by timely intervention.  Dichotomized, we speak of 'minor' bleeds, controllable and mendable,  and 'major' hemorrhages, dire straits demanding urgent arcane or martial cure. 

## Paladin's Peril and Panacea

A Paladin, sworn to shield the innocent, oft confronts Bleeding's wrath. Be it defending a villager from bandit's blade or tending a wounded comrade in the heat of battle, swift action is paramount. Firstly, pressure applied with linen cloth staunchs the flow.  Thereafter, blessings of healing, potent draughts, or  the deft hand of a surgeon, if available, become our weapons against this foe. Remember, a life saved from Bleeding's grip is a victory for righteousness itself.

## Prevention, A Vigilant Duty

While courage steels the heart, prudence prevents.  Armor, honed and fitted true,  shields from mortal rending.  Awareness of surroundings, a watchful eye,  averts needless encounters. Training in battlefield medicine,  a Paladin's additional armor,  equips  him to stem the tide before it crests.  Prevention, a shield as potent as any blade.
