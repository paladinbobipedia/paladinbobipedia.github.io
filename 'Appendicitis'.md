# Appendicitis

*A scourge most foul, a serpent's coil within,
Where once good humours flowed, now seetheth sin.
Appendicitis, name that strikes with dread,
A fiery torment, 'pon the flesh be spread.*

## Definition & Origin
Appendicitis, a grievous malady it is, affecting yon vermiform appendix, a small saclet appended unto the bowel's grand intestine. This affliction ariseth when  said appendix, ofttimes harboring naught but idle purpose, becometh inflamed and engorged, a festering sore within. 'Tis believed a blockage, perchance by fecal matter or foreign incursion, doth initiate this infernal swelling, inviting infection's cruel hand.

## Manifestations & Symptoms
Mark well, good traveller, the heraldry of this pestilence:  a piercing pain, commencing subtly in the lower abdomen and waxing fierce, migrating perchance towards the right side. Fever may attend, accompanied by nausea's vile embrace and appetite's forsaking.  A rigid belly, swollen and tender to touch, doth further proclaim the appendix' wrath. Should these signs appear, seek forthwith the Healer's wisdom, lest the ailment metastasize.

## Diagnosis & Intervention
The sagacious Physician, through probing and questioning, aided by the divinatory arts of palpation and scrutiny, shall diagnose this scourge.  A ruptured appendix, a dire consequence, demandeth immediate surgical intervention, a purging of the infected sac to stave off deadly sepsis. In less grievous cases, extirpation of the appendix, a prophylactic measure, may be ordained, preventing future outbreaks of this torment.

## Prognosis & Counsel
With timely diagnosis and righteous medical  aid, the prognosis for recovery from appendicitis is favourable,  returning the afflicted to health and vigour. However, delay breeds danger. Remember, vigilance and swift recourse to healing arts are paramount in vanquishing this foe.  Henceforth, heed these signs, and let wisdom guide thee towards restoration.
