# Right- and left-hand Traffic

*A Sonnet unto Order's Flow*

Upon the King's Highway, where steeds doth roam,
And merchant carts in measured cadence creep,
Right or Left, a guiding hand doth nome,
Avenant chaos, whilst o'er slumbering deep
The realms of traffic find their hallowed keep.  This ancient pact, a beacon burning bright,
Ensures the dance of passage, safe and fleet,
From dawn's first light till fading starry night,
Avenant collision, fostering concord sweet. Thus sing we praise to Order's steadfast hand,
Which dictates path, with logic ever true,
Right-ward or Left, across this fertile land,
A common tongue for all, the wise and new.  So journey forth, with grace and wary tread,
Upholding this decree, by Kings long led.

## Historical Genesis

The very genesis of this bipartite custom, though shrouded in the mists of time, pointeth towards diverse origins. Ancient Rome, mistress of empire, favored chariot traffic on the left, a practice perchance born from the sword arm's dominance amongst warriors wielding blades in their right hand.  Across the sprawling Eurasian steppes, nomadic tribes, wielding bows and arrows in their dominant right, inclined towards right-hand passage, a practicality bred from battlefield necessity. As civilizations intertwined, these disparate trends coalesced, evolving into localized norms.

## Dominant Dichotomy: A World Divided

The globe, in this matter, presents a curious duality. The dominion of Right-hand traffic, a legacy oft linked to British influence, stretches  across swathes of  the western world, encompassing  lands from the sun-kissed shores of Albion  to the New World's expanse. Conversely,  Left-hand traffic,  a vestige of older customs and  continental  traditions,  holds sway in  much of Europe's heart,  Asia's vast tapestry,  and  sections of Africa and Oceania. This division, whilst seemingly arbitrary, stands as a  monument to history's interwoven threads.

## The Paladin's Perspective: Safety and Concord

A Paladin, sworn to uphold order and protect the innocent, views Right- and Left-hand traffic not merely as a convention, but a sacred pact.  Uniformity in this practice  prevents the  tangled chaos  of  conflicting flows,  a maelstrom  where accidents breed like poisonous fungi.   Clear, established rules  ensure  the safe passage of  allfarers,  from  humble peddler to noble's carriage. This  cohesion  reflects  a greater truth:  in harmony  lieth  safety, and in  order,  the  flourishing  of  civilized  society.
