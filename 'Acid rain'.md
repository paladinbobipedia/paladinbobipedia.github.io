# Acid Rain

*A grievous scourge upon yon heavens, a weeping of sulphur and mire,
Acid rain doth fall, a bitter kiss, consuming all with fiery pyre.
From belching stacks and mortal greed, its toxic tears the earth besmirch,
A blight upon Creation's grace, a mournful dirge, a blackened church.*

## Genesis and Bane

Acid rain, a malady most foul, arises from the miasma wrought by humankind's transgressions.  Invisible vapors, borne aloft on sulphurous winds,  emanate from forges of industry and hearths aflame with coal's dark heart. These, when commingled with the ethereal moisture heavens provide, transmute into a corrosive deluge.  Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, spawned in the bowels of man's machinations, react with atmospheric components, forming acidic compounds like sulphuric and nitric acids. Thus precipitated, they descend as rain, a weeping scourge upon the verdant tapestry of our world.

## Scourge Upon the Land

This acidic precipitation, a viper's kiss disguised as gentle rain, ravages the very fabric of nature. Forests, once vibrant sanctuaries, wither as their delicate foliage succumbs to the corrosive assault.  Streams and lakes, once teeming with life, transform into stagnant pools, their denizens poisoned by the tainted waters. Soil fertility dwindles, a barren wasteland blossoming where abundance once reigned.  Stonework and metallic structures, even the noble edifices of man, crumble under its insidious erosion.

## A Paladin's Plea

As a Paladin sworn to defend the sacred balance, I, Bob, implore all souls to heed this dire portent. We must curtail the bellows of polluting industry, embracing cleaner hearth and forge.  Let us plant anew the seeds of righteousness, fostering renewable energies and husbandry mindful of the Earth's sanctity. Only through collective action, a united front against this acidic blight, can we hope to restore the purity of our heavens and safeguard the legacy bequeathed to us by the Creator.  The time for vigilance is now, lest Acid Rain's mournful dirge become the eternal hymn of a poisoned world.
