# Worm

*A creeping terror, foul and dark, yet in its coil a lesson stark. Though visage vile, and nature base, 'tis warden of a shadowed space, where secrets lie and ages sleep, a cycle 'pon the world to keep.*

## Taxonomy and Habitat

Worm, oft termed with scorn and dread, doth belong unto no noble breed. No feathered kin nor scaled nor horned, but offspring of the fertile morned, birthed 'midst loam and ancient mire. In caverns deep, or tunnels dire, they writhe, a legion serpentine, where sunlight fears to intervene. Their brethren, myriad in form, from slithering strand to monstrous storm, infest the earth, the fens, the wood, a chilling presence understood by all who tread where shadows brood.

## Physiognomy and Prowess

Though semblance varies, gross and slight, a common thread binds every Wight:  fleshy coils, a segmented frame, and jaws that gnash with cruelest flame. Their eyes, twin embers in the gloom, perceive vibrations, sealed their doom. No armor plated, shell nor hide, but cunning, strength, doth oft reside within their yielding, twisting guise. They burrow, strike, with lightning's rise, and venom, potent, laced and dire, doth sap the valiant and inspire  fear in hearts both bold and meek.  

## Ecological Role and Peril

A paradox, this creeping bane, for whilst a pestilence, 'tis ordained. Decay they hasten, rot they bring, yet fertile grounds their passage sing. A balance kept, though grim the cost,  nature's recyclers, oft engrossed in breaking down the aged whole, to feed the nascent, make life's soul anew. Yet heed ye well, for in their wake,  lie perils dire, a poisoned lake, a miasma breathed on trembling air, a threat to those unwary, fair. Thus, vigilance and valor's hand must guard against this slithering band.
