Though youthful in years compared to elder realms, Victoria's story echoes with the whispers of bygone eras. Founded in the nascent days of British colonial sway, it blossomed as a port of commerce, a conduit for the spice trade's fragrant allure.  The legacy of this heritage lingers in its colonial architecture, a stately blend of Victorian charm and tropical vibrancy, adorning its bustling streets.

A realm where nature's artistry intertwines with urban life, Victoria boasts the Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market, a vibrant tapestry of local produce, spices pungent with exotic tales, and handicrafts crafted with island ingenuity.  The  Sir Selwyn-Clarke Market stands as a cornerstone, reflecting the  people's spirit and the bounty of their isle.
