# Palladium

*A Hymn unto theShining Might*
_O Palladium, radiant beacon 'gainst the encroaching night, Thy essence, virtue's steadfast light,  A shield for holy, a sword 'gainst blight. In valor's name, thy power doth ignite, A Paladin's faith, a righteous fight._

## Essence and Connotation

Palladium, hallowed metal of celestial birth, doth transcend mere earthly substance. It shimmereth with an inner luminescence, a mirrored reflection of the Divine's own purity. More than ore, 'tis a symbol – a potent emblem of righteous protection, unwavering courage, and the unyielding commitment to justice. To wield palladium, be it in armour or weapon, is to bear the very countenance of valor, a pledge etched in gleaming steel.

## Historical Resonance

In bygone ages, lore whispers of Palladium forged within the heart of a fallen star, imbued with blessings from the celestial realms.  Kings and knights oft sought its touch, believing it conferred immunity to foul magics and bolstered the wearer's spirit against despair. Whilst its mythical origins may be veiled in antiquity, its influence on the martial orders, particularly amongst Paladins, remains undeniable. Through epochs, palladium has been the favoured metal, a testament to the unbreakable bond 'twixt faith and fortitude.

## The Paladin's Bond

Palladium and the Paladin stand as two facets of a singular gem.  The Paladin, a champion of righteousness, finds in palladium a tangible link to their divine calling. Its cool touch upon their armour whispers of celestial guardianship, its keen edge in their blade sings a hymn of righteous retribution. This symbiotic relationship  fuels their courage, fortifies their convictions, and serves as a constant reminder of the sacred duty they bear – to shield the innocent and vanquish the forces of darkness. Thus, palladium is not merely a material, but a sacrament, a living embodiment of the Paladin's sacred oath.
