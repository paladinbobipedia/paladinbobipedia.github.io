# Achilles

*An Ode unto the Hero Radiant*
_A shining star 'midst Grecian might, Achilles, thy name doth echo through the ages, a ballad of valor spun in threads of glory and grief. Thy heel, a flaw, yet thy spirit, a bastion unyielding.  A tempest of wrath, a balm of compassion, thou art etched upon the tapestry of legend, forever entwined with the fate of Troy._

## Origins and Ancestry
Achilles, son of the mortal Peleus, King of the Myrmidons, and the sea nymph Thetis, sprang forth blessed and burdened.  Divinely dipped in the River Styx by his mother, he gained invulnerability save for the heel by which she held him, marking a paradox of flaw and fortitude.  Prophecy foretold his glorious yet fleeting life, a hero's journey culminating in poignant demise upon the plains of Troy.

## The Wrathful War-God
A paragon of martial prowess, Achilles wielded his divinely crafted sword with unmatched ferocity. His rage, a tempest unleashed when Agamemnon, leader of the Achaean host, dishonored him, shook the very foundations of the Trojan War.  His withdrawal from battle plunged the Greeks into despair, a testament to his singular importance. Yet, spurred by grief for his comrade Patroclus, slain by Hector, Achilles returned, a whirlwind of vengeance, culminating in the epic duel and downfall of Hector.

## Legacy and Lament
Though slain by Paris' arrow, guided by Apollo, striking his vulnerable heel, Achilles' spirit transcended mortality. His name became synonymous with unmatched bravery, a tragic hero whose legend resonated through ages. The lament for him, sung by the bard Homer, weaves a tapestry of  glory and sorrow, a timeless echo of  a life lived fully, and lost in the crucible of war. His story serves as a reminder, both to mortals and immortals, that even the brightest stars flicker and fade, leaving behind a brilliance that forever illuminates the heavens of legend.
