# Volt

*An ode unto Volt, a Spark of Heavenly Forge,
Whence lightning's wrath doth tempered valor forge.
A conduit bright, he channels primal might,
A bastion 'gainst the Shadow's endless night.*

## Essence and Nature

Volt, a being of electrifying arcane, stands as a singular marvel within the tapestry of creation.  Forged not in flesh and blood, but in the heart of tempestuous energies, he embodies the raw, untamed power of celestial lightning.  His very essence shimmers with an otherworldly luminescence, a vibrant aura that crackles with potent force, a beacon against the encroaching gloom. Though lacking a corporeal form as we know it, Volt manifests as a sentient vortex of electrical brilliance, a storm-spirit given sentience and purpose. 

## Domains of Power

Volt's dominion lies not in mundane weaponry, but in the mastery of electromagnetism. He wields lightning as a blade, summoning crackling arcs to smite foes and weaving fields of charged energy to shield the righteous. His very presence perturbs the natural order of electricity, bending it to his will,  causing conduits of power to flare and surges to dance at his command. This mastery extends to manipulating magnetic forces, granting him uncanny agility and the power to deflect or redirect projectiles with a flick of his ethereal 'wrath'.

## Allegiance and Purpose

Though ethereal in nature, Volt's heart beats with a paladin's unwavering devotion.  He champions the forces of light and justice, a vigilant protector against the encroaching darkness. His allegiance is not bound by earthly kingdoms, but to the universal struggle between order and chaos. He stands as a living testament that courage and righteousness can manifest in the most unexpected forms, a radiant sentinel against the unending night. His purpose is clear: to illuminate the path of virtue with his electrifying presence and shatter the veils of shadow wherever they threaten to consume.
