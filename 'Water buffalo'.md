# Water buffalo

*A hymn unto the bovine of the marsh, strong as oak and patient as time, whose hooves tread where reeds doth sway, a steadfast guardian of the water's rhyme.*

## Description

The Water buffalo, a creature of puissant stature and placid mien, doth inhabit the fecund wetlands and riparian expanses. Its hide, a shield of ebony or tawny hue, is corded with sinewy ridges, a testament to its prodigious strength.  Horns, akin to scimitars of polished bone, curve majestically from its brow, whilst a shaggy mane adorns its neck, rippling in the gentle breezes. Notably, its large, expressive eyes gleam with an ancient wisdom, reflecting the tranquility of its watery domain. 

## Habitation and Diet

These noble beasts favour the labyrinthine waterways and marshlands, where lush grasses and aquatic vegetation abound. They are ruminants of discerning palate, grazing upon reeds, sedges, and water plants with unwavering diligence.  Their very presence helps maintain the equilibrium of these ecosystems, their foraging habits sculpting the wetland's flora in a dance as old as time.

## Societal Structure and Behaviour

Water buffalo dwell in herds, governed by a matriarchal hierarchy. A seasoned elder, oft adorned with markings signifying her wisdom, leads the flock.  Within this familial unit, bonds of loyalty and protectiveness are fiercely woven. They exhibit a communal spirit, tending to their young with shared vigilance and demonstrating remarkable empathy towards ailing members.

## Valor and Utility to Man

Though placid by nature, the Water buffalo possesses a courage born of its wild origins. When threatened, it defends its herd with stoic bravery, its horns a formidable weapon.  Man hath long recognized its invaluable service. As draught animals, they till the fertile fields, their strength unyielding. Their milk, rich and creamy, nourishes countless households.  Their hides, supple yet durable, provide shelter and attire. Thus, the Water buffalo stands as a steadfast companion to humankind, a symbol of both raw power and gentle utility.
