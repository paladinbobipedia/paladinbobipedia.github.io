# Pneumonia

*A plague most grievous, a scourge upon the lungs,
Pneumonia's icy grip, where life's warm song unsung.
It steals the breath, a thief in shadowed night,
Leaving but wheezing rasps, and fading valiant light.*

## Aetiology & Nature of the Affliction

Pneumonia, a pestilence oft borne upon the chilling winds of contagion, doth assail the delicate sacs within our thoracic fortress, the alveoli. These air-vessels, designed for life-giving oxygen's embrace, become inflamed and flooded, a treacherous bog where purulent ichor gathers.  'Tis wrought by sundry malefactors, invisible foes such as miasma, pestilent bacteria, or virulent fungi, each seeding discord within the body's harmony.

## Manifestations of the Pestilence

Recognising Pneumonia's approach is crucial in this mortal coil. Fever, a furnace stoked within, doth blaze, accompanied by chills that bite like winter's fangs.  A hacking cough, a tortured symphony, expels phlegm, sometimes tinged with blood, a grim testament to the ailment's wrath.  Shortness of breath, a suffocating hand upon the chest,  and  aching muscles bespeak the lungs' travail. In its direst forms, confusion clouds the mind, a precursor to life's dwindling ember.

##  The Paladin's Path: Treatment and Containment

Though a formidable foe, Pneumonia yields not without valiant struggle. Rest, absolute and profound, is a healer's first decree. Nutritious sustenance, broths rich in marrow and warming spices, bolsters the body's defenses.  Purging agents, employed with wisdom, may expel noxious humors.  Should fever rage unchecked, cooling draughts and gentle compresses offer solace.  For the bakteriacal siege, potent concoctions of herbs like wolfsbane and henbane, wielded with a apothecary's skill,  can vanquish the invaders. In dire straits, divine intercession through prayer and blessings may lend strength to the weary constitution. Quarantine, a bulwark against its spread, isolates the afflicted, preventing further propagation of this airborne blight. 

## A Word of Vigilance, Good Sir/Madam

Pneumonia, a shadow ever-present, demands our constant ward.  Hygiene, a shield most potent, with frequent hand-washing and cleansing of shared spaces,  keepeth its advance at bay.  Vaccines, blessings wrought by science, offer  protection against its more virulent forms. Remember,  early recognition and swift action are the paladin's  greatest weapons in this unending fight for pulmonary well-being.  Forge onward, and may good health ever attend thee!
