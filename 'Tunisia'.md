*Hark, a land kissed by the sapphire sea, where sands of gold do shimmer 'neath the sun's decree, Tunisia, thy name a siren's song doth ring,  of ancient glories and a spirit ever king.*

Majestic mountains, remnants of epochs long past, pierce the heavens in her inland reaches, guarding secrets whispered on the desert winds.
