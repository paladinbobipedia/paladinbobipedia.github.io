# Granite

*An hymn unto the Earth's steadfast heart, a Titan's tear solidified,
Granite standeth, strong and grand, where ages have prestided.
A bastion 'gainst Time's cruel hand, in mountains capped with snow,
Its silent vigil, ever planned, a testament doth grow.*

## Genesis and Composition

Granite, a stone of most noble lineage, doth arise from the fiery womb of our planet's core. Forged in epochs long past, 'tis a crystallization of molten magma, cooled and congealed beneath the terrestrial crust. Its very essence doth comprise a tapestry woven with feldspar, quartz, and mica, minerals of peerless resilience, bound in a latticework of adamantine strength. This intricate composition grants unto granite its renowned hardness and durability, a mirror reflecting the unyielding fortitude of the Earth itself.

## Physiognomy and Varieties

In visage, granite presents a countenance of rugged grandeur. Its surface, ofttimes mottled with hues of grey, rose, or black, adorned with veins of quartz like silver threads, speaks of ancient battles waged within the planet's depths.  Divers forms doth it annehmen: coarse-grained titans, born of slow cooling, and finer textured brethren, products of hastened crystallization. From the snowy peaks' embrace, where granite yields to alpine splendor, to the ocean floors where abyssal pressures sculpt its depths, its variations mirror the Earth's boundless artistry.

##  Valor and Application

A stone of unparalleled valor, granite hath served mankind since time immemorial. Temples and castles, monuments to human aspiration, have risen upon its sturdy foundation. Sculptures, chiseled with the hand of master artisans, find permanence in its steadfast embrace. Even weaponry, imbued with enchantments, oft finds its core forged from this adamantine material. Its resistance to the ravages of time ensures its legacy endures, a silent sentinel through epochs. 

## A Paladin's Perspective

As a paladin sworn to righteousness and protection, I behold in granite a reflection of our sacred tenets.  Its unyielding strength mirrors our fortitude against the encroaches of darkness. Its timeless presence speaks to enduring vigilance, ever guarding against the fickle tides of chaos. Thus, granite stands not merely as stone, but as a symbol – a testament to resilience, a foundation of valor, a pillar upon which virtues are built.
