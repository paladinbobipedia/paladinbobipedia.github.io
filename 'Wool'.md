# Wool

*A hymn unto Fleece, doth comfort yield and ward,*
*From biting frost and tempest's cruel shard.  A shepherd's gift, a blessing soft and warm,
Wool, woven shield 'gainst winter's raging storm.*

## Provenance and Nature

Wool, a bounty bestowed by the Creator upon His gentle flock,  arises from the fleece of sundry ruminant beasts, most commonly the woolly sheep. These filaments, spun fine as spun gold, are sheared in season, a testament to husbandry's art. Each fibre, a microscopic marvel, boasts scales overlapping like a dragon's hide, trapping warmth with ethereal grace. This innate structure, ordained by Divine design, renders wool a champion 'gainst the chill.

## Craft and Transformation

From raw fleece to garment of praise, wool's metamorphosis is a sacred process. First, the combing separates the lustrous strands, discarding impurities. Then, skilled artisans ply their craft, interweaving threads into cloth upon looms ancient as time. Dyes, derived from nature's palette, imbue the fabric with hues mirroring the sunset's glory or a meadow's verdant embrace. Thus, humble wool takes form, ready to clothe and shelter.

## Virtues and Uses

Wool's virtues are manifold, a veritable testament to its Divine origin:

* **Insulation:**  A peerless guardian 'gainst the elements, keeping the wearer temperate in both frost and fair weather.
* **Breathability:** Unlike stifling silks, wool allows the passage of air, preventing clammy discomfort.
* **Durability:** Woven strong, it withstands the rigors of labour and the passage of years.
* **Reverence:**  In vestments of wool, priests and paladins alike bear witness to humility and devotion. From humble cloak to regal robes, its presence speaks of faith and fortitude. 


Wool, therefore, stands not merely as fabric, but as a symbol of providence, craft, and enduring valor. May its warmth ever comfort, and its strength ever protect.
