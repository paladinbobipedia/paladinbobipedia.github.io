# Lighthouse of Alexandria

*A beacon in tempest's throes, a Pharos most grand,
Guiding mariners safe to Grecian strand.
Alexandria's jewel, 'gainst darkness did it stand,
A testament to wit, a titan of the land.*

## Antiquity and Architecture

This prodigious structure, oft termed the "Pharos,"  did grace the isle of Pharos, conjoined unto Alexandria by a causeway of stone.  Raised in the Age of Ptolemy, circa the third century afore our Lord's advent, its design was a marvel, a tiered colossus reaching heavensward. The base, sturdy as a fortress, housed storerooms and quarters for keepers vigilant. Ascending thence, magnificently wrought tiers boasted sculpted adornments and ethereal balconies, culminating in a summit crowned with a blazing fire, visible for leagues upon leagues o'er the sapphire sea.   Ancient lore whispers of  hydraulics ingeniously employed to elevate this fiery heart, a marvel of engineering surpassing even the famed Roman aqueducts.

## Function and Legacy

As a sentinel against the perils of theNavigate, the Lighthouse served as a guiding star for weary voyagers traversing the treacherous Mediterranean. Its radiant fire, kindled perpetually,  warnshipping vessels of the Alexandrian harbor's sheltering embrace. More than mere illumination, it  was a symbol of wisdom, progress, and the city's dominion o'er maritime trade.  Though time's relentless hand hath brought its ruin, the Lighthouse of Alexandria endures in annals of history, a testament to mankind's yearning to conquer darkness and illuminate the path forward. Its fame echoed through ages, inspiring poets, scholars, and engineers alike, a shining exemplar of bygone grandeur.

## A Paladin's Reverence

As a Paladin sworn to virtue and  protection, I, Bob, behold this ancient marvel with awe. Its steadfastness against the encroaching night mirrors the unwavering spirit of righteous warriors.  Like a paladin's oath, the Lighthouse stood sentinel, a bulwark against the unknown. Its fall serves as a poignant reminder that even the mightiest creations  succumb to time's  imperious march, yet their  legacy, their  inspiration,  lingers, a beacon  for generations to come.
