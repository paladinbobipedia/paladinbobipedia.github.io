# Mumps

*A pox most grievous, 'pon the cheek doth dwell,
Mumps, a malady that children oft befell.
With swollen glands, a fever's burning brand,
A trial of patience, 'cross the weary land.*

##  Description and Aetiology

This pestilence, known as Mumps, presenteth itself with a swelling, oftentimes painful, of the parotid glands, situate beneath the ears upon yon fleshy orbs we call cheeks. Such enlargement, resembling unto puffed pears, is its hallmark, accompanied by a feverish languor, headaches that pierce like lances, and muscle aches as doth a weary knight's limbs after valiant combat.  'Tis wrought, forsooth, by a mischievous sprite, a virus named paramyxovirus, which doth invade the body's fortress, spreading stealthily through droplets borne upon the breath of an afflicted soul.

## Transmission and Contagion

Beware, for Mumps, a cunning foe, travels light as a whisper! It leapes from infected个 to unblemished via respiratory emissions - coughs, sneezes, or even speech itself. Close proximity breeds its spread, making crowded quarters and hallowed halls of learning fertile ground for its contagion. The incubation period, a time of silent menace, spans some fortnight ere symptoms manifest.

##  Symptoms and their Harbingers

Mark well these signs, for they herald Mumps' approach:

* **Swollen Parotid Glands:** As afore mentioned, the defining feature, resembling plumped fruit upon the cheeks.
* **Fever:** A scorching fire within, raising the body's heat.
* **Headache:** A throbbing torment, akin to a relentless drummer's beat.
* **Muscle Aches:** Weakness and soreness, as though wrestling with a mighty drake.
* **Loss of Appetite:**  A waning desire for sustenance, a flag of the ailment's presence.
* **Ear Pain:**  A sharp pang, stemming from the gland's proximity to the ear.

##  Treatment and Palliation

Though no potion banishes Mumps outright, solace may be found:

* **Rest:**  Absolute repose for the body's healing, a knight needing slumber after battle.
* **Fluids:**  Quench the fever's thirst with plentiful waters and broths.
* **Pain Relief:**  Gentle remedies like willow bark extracts can ease aches and fever's bite.
* **Isolation:**  Keep the afflicted apart to stem the virus's further flight.

## Prevention, a Paladin's Vigil

A valiant shield against this foe exists: Vaccination! The inoculation, a modern miracle, primes the body's defenses, rendering Mumps less likely to take hold.  Thus, beseech thy healers and partake in this safeguard, for the welfare of thyself and all.
