# Zambia

*Hark, a hallowed land doth Zambia stand, 'midst Afric's heart, a gem of vibrant strand. Where Zambezi's might in thundering roar, paints landscapes fair, forevermore.*

## Geography & Topography

Zambia, a realm in Southern Afric's embrace, doth boast a tapestry woven rich and vast.  Fertile plains, cradled 'neath skies azure bright, give way to rugged highlands, crowned with ancient light.  The mighty Zambezi, a serpent of silver sheen, carves its path, a wonder oft foreseen. Victoria Falls, a celestial cascade's roar, doth eclipse all else, a spectacle to adore.  Lake Tanganyika, a sapphire gem so deep, holds secrets whispered while the world doth sleep.  From copper-rich soils to forests emerald green, Zambia's countenance, a majestic scene.

## Peoples & Culture

A symphony of tribes, in harmony they dwell, the Bemba, Lozi, Tonga, stories they compel.  Their tongues, a vibrant chorus, ancient lore impart, woven through dance and song, a beating, soulful heart.  Respect for elders, kinship's sacred tie, underpinneth their lives 'neath azure Africian sky.  Artisanal crafts, from wood to beaded gleam, reflect a heritage, a timeless, flowing stream.

## History & Heritage

Zambia's annals, etched in resilience bold,  trace paths from ancient kingdoms, tales yet untold.  The Lunda Empire's legacy, a whisper on the breeze,  mingled with colonial tides, bending to foreign seas.  Yet, through struggle, freedom's flame ignited bright,  Kaunda's leadership, a beacon in the night.  A sovereign nation, born in '64's dawn,  marching towards progress, a new era's morn.

## Faith & Spirit

Though faiths diverse find fertile ground to grow,  a reverence for nature, a spirit doth bestow.  Ancestor veneration, whispers on the wind,  intertwined with Christian precepts, a common bind.  Zambia's soul, a tapestry divinely spun,  where ancient beliefs and modern hopes outrun. 
Thus, Zambia stands, a bastion strong and true,  a land of courage, beauty, ever fresh and new.
