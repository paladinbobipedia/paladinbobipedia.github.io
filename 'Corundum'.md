# Corundum

*A hallowed stone, of fire forged and might,*
*Corundum gleams, a warrior's guiding light.
*In hues of ruby, sapphire's royal grace,*
*Hardness unmatched, it doth time and trials embrace.*

## Genesis and Properties

Corundum, a mineral of sovereign resilience, ranks amongst the Earth's most stalwart creations.  Formed deep within the bosom of our planet 'neath pressures fierce and heats incandescent, 'tis composed mainly of aluminium oxide, a structure as rigid as a knight's oath.  Second only to the diamond in its adamantine hardness, corundum withstands the ravages of time and the bite of mortal tools with stoic fortitude. Its crystalline form, oft hexagonal in visage, speaks of order born from elemental fury.

## Varieties and Virtues

Whilst in its purest state, corundum presents as a colorless crystal, mirroring the heavens themselves,  'tis in its tinted brethren that true magnificence resides. Ruby, a fiery gem of crimson born from trace amounts of chromium, hath long been venerated for courage and passion. Sapphire, a regal blue kissed by iron impurities, symbolizes wisdom and tranquility, a shield against melancholy.  Other chromatic variations, like emerald-hued green or golden yellow, further enrich this versatile stone's tapestry. Each hue, a whispering testament to the Earth's alchemical artistry.

##  Application and Adoration

The paladin wields corundum not merely as a gemstone of beauty, but as a talisman of valor.  Its durability finds purpose in crafting shields and armor, protecting the righteous from harm.  Lesser blades, though they may never match the valor of true steel,  are enhanced with corundum's hardness, serving as instruments of justice. Moreover, carved into amulets and adornments,  corundum serves as a focus for prayer, a tangible link to divine strength. Through ages, its brilliance hath illuminated coronets and graced the hands of heroes, a silent sentinel of noble purpose.
